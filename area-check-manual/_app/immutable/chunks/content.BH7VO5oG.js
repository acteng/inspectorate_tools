1.1 This user manual is a desktop guide for the Route Check. The tool is a ‘scheme
review’ tool used for assessing the design quality of linear street or path schemes.
This tool can be used in both urban and rural contexts. It is similar in style to the
‘Cycling Level of Service’^1 and ‘Healthy Streets Check for Designers’^2 tools released
by the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL). This user
manual allows you to assess and score streets and paths against various metrics
under the categories of safety, accessibility, comfort, directness, attractiveness and
cohesion. However, unlike the ‘Cycling Level of Service’ tool, it also accounts for the
user experience of people walking and wheeling, including people with disabilities.

1.2 The Route Check is used by ATE for assessing the design quality of linear schemes.
However, it may also be used by local authorities and others wishing to assess the
design quality of schemes against ATE’s quality criteria.

1.3 When ATE uses the Route Check to assess the design quality of active travel
infrastructure, the main goal is not to pass or fail schemes. Rather, its primary purpose
is to remind designers of key active travel policies, promote best practice and prompt
discussions about design solutions.

1.4 The Route Check is also intended for use throughout the scheme design process,
meaning that you can identify critical issues and other problems at the feasibility stage
and design them out in later stages before construction.

1.5 This document is divided into 13 chapters. The next chapter is an overview of the
Route Check tool’s structure, and subsequent chapters (3–13) give more information
on each different section of the tool (see Figure 1).

1.6 The Route Check tool includes a Policy Check section (described in Chapter 4) and
accompanying Policy Conflict Log (described in Chapter 5). In these sections of the
Route Check, you can assess schemes against six active travel policy principles and
log any instances of policy conflicts. These six principles, derived from Inclusive
Mobility, LTN 1/20 and Gear Change, are key to making sure that active travel
schemes are inclusive for everyone walking, wheeling and cycling, including people
with disabilities.

1.7 Chapter 6 introduces the Safety Check section, where you can score the scheme
against 16 safety metrics and check for the presence of safety-related critical issues.
You can then log any critical issues you find in the Critical Issues Log, which is dealt
with in Chapter 7.

1.8 When assessing a street-based scheme, you must fill in the Street Check (introduced
in Chapter 8) and the Street Placemaking Scheme (introduced in Chapter 9). When
assessing a traffic-free path, you must fill in the Path Check (introduced in Chapter 10)
and the Path Placemaking Check (introduced in Chapter 11).

1.9 The Route Check also introduces a new version of the Junction Assessment Tool
(JAT), a framework for assessing pedestrian and cycle movements at junctions. LTN
1/20 introduced a version of the JAT nationally, but that version of the JAT only covered
cycle movements at junctions. The Route Check introduces an expanded version of
this framework, which also accounts for pedestrian movements. You must assess and
score cyclist and pedestrian movements on certain types of junction along the route.
You can find more information on this section, including which junction types must be
assessed in the JAT, in Chapter 12.

1.10 Chapter 13 introduces the Results tabs and explains how to interpret results and what
might happen after a Route Check has been completed. It also contains information
on how the Route Check calculates scores.

2.1 The Route Check, being an Excel-based tool, uses various tabs to categorise and
organise the design assessment process. These tabs are divided into input tabs and
output tabs. Some input tabs are mandatory, and others are optional. Every tab
corresponds to a chapter in this user manual.

2.2 The input and output tabs are summarised in Figure 2 below, which shows them in the
order they appear in the spreadsheet, as well as which tabs are optional depending on
whether a street or path is being assessed.

Figure 2 – Summary of the Route Check workflow in terms of the tabs in the
spreadsheet

2.3 This chapter explains these tabs in more detail.

Input tabs

2.4 The first five tabs are all mandatory input tabs (Figure 3). These are coloured green,
and must be completed regardless of whether your scheme is based on streets or
traffic-free paths.

Figure 3 – The first five input tabs, which are mandatory to complete for all schemes.


2.5 The Summary of Scheme tab must be completed. Here, you fill in details of the
scheme such as its name, length, design stage and wider network context. It is
also traffic-free paths. It is highly important that you select this correctly as it affects
how the spreadsheet works. More information can be found in Chapter 3 of this
user manual.

2.6 The Policy Check tab asks you to answer six questions about how well the existing
situation and proposed design align with six active travel policy principles. You must
complete this tab for all schemes. You can find more information in Chapter 4 of this
user manual. All Route Check questions and metrics have a unique code which
references the relevant section of the tool. The ‘PO’ prefix is used for the six Policy
Check questions (PO01–PO06).

2.7 The Policy Conflict Log tab is where you are asked to log each existing policy
conflict as well as any thrown up by the proposed scheme design. This section is
separate from the Policy Check because there may be multiple instances of the same
policy conflict on the same route. You must log each of these individually, adding
location and other information. If there are no policy conflicts in the existing scheme or
design, you can leave this section blank. You can find more information on the Policy
Conflict Log section of the tool in Chapter 5 of this user manual.

2.8 In the Safety Check tab, you must assess and score the existing situation and
proposed design against 16 safety metrics, each of which could potentially score as a
‘critical issue’. This tab must be completed for all types of scheme. Some safety
metrics may be less applicable to traffic-free path schemes. If this is the case, you can
choose ‘not applicable’ as your answer if the metric doesn’t apply. The SA prefix is
used for the 16 Safety Check metrics (SA01–SA16). You can find more information
on the Safety Check in Chapter 6 of this user manual.

2.9 The Critical Issues Log tab is where you are asked to log every critical issue present
in the existing situation as well as in the proposed scheme design. This section is
separate from the Safety Check because there may be multiple instances of the same
safety conflict on the same route. You must log each of these individually, adding
location and other information. If there are no critical issues in the existing scheme or
design, you can leave this section blank. You can find more information on the Critical
Issues Log section of the tool in Chapter 7.

2.10 The next two Route Check tabs (Figure 4) are also input tabs. You must complete
them if the scheme is based on a street and leave them empty if it is based on a
traffic-free path.

\`\`\`
4.1. Street Check 4.2. Street Placemaking Check
\`\`\`
Figure 4 – The two ‘street’ input tabs, which are mandatory to complete for street-
based schemes.


2.11 The Street Check tab asks you to assess and score the existing situation and
proposed scheme design against 26 metrics categorised under accessibility, comfort,
directness, attractiveness and cohesion. You must complete this tab for all street-
based schemes. The ST prefix is used for the 26 Street Check metrics (ST17–ST42).
You can find more information in Chapter 8 of this user manual.

2.12 The Street Placemaking tab asks you to assess and score the existing situation and
proposed scheme design against 26 street placemaking metrics, categorised under
social activity, personal security, character and legibility and the environment. The SP
prefix is used for the 26 Street Placemaking Check metrics (SP1–SP26). You can
find more information in Chapter 9 of this user manual.

2.13 The next two Route Check tabs (Figure 5) are also input tabs and you must complete
them if the scheme is based on a traffic-free path and leave them empty if it is based
on a street.

\`\`\`
5.1. Path Check 5.2. Path Placemaking Check
\`\`\`
Figure 5 – The two ‘path’ input tabs, which are mandatory to complete for schemes
based on traffic-free paths.

2.14 The Path Check tab asks you to assess and score the existing situation and
proposed scheme design against 30 metrics categorised under accessibility, comfort,
directness, attractiveness and cohesion. This tab must be completed for all schemes
based on traffic-free paths. The PA prefix is used for the 30 Path Check metrics
(PA17– PA46). You can find more information in Chapter 10.

2.15 The Path Placemaking Check tab asks you to assess and score the existing
situation and proposed scheme design against 19 path placemaking metrics,
categorised under social activity, personal security, character and legibility, and the
environment. The PP prefix is used for the 19 Path Placemaking Check metrics
(PP01–PP19). You can find more information in Chapter 11 of this user manual.

2.16 The final input tab in Route Check is the JAT Check tab (Figure 6), which must be
completed if there are specific junction types along the route, regardless of whether
the scheme is based on streets or traffic-free paths. The JAT Check tab contains the
Junction Assessment Tool Check, which asks you to assess and score pedestrian and
cycle movements at certain types of junction for both the existing situation and
proposed scheme design. You must complete the JAT Check if the scheme has any of
these types of junctions. You can find more information on the JAT Check, including
which junction types you must assess and score, in Chapter 12.

contain signal-controlled junctions or roundabouts.


2.17 It sometimes happens that while you are filling in the later tabs in Route Check and
getting into the design details, you may reconsider scores in the earlier tabs, or notice
extra policy conflicts or critical issues that you did not log previously. You can always
go back to earlier tabs and amend or add to them.

Output tabs

2.18 The final three Route Check tabs (Figure 7) are all output tabs, which are coloured
purple and give the results of the Route Check assessments in three different forms.
You can find more information on these tabs in Chapter 13.

\`\`\`
7.1. Results Summary 7.2. Results Further Analysis 7.3. Results Export
\`\`\`
Figure 7 – The three output tabs

2.19 The Results Summary tab gives a concise snapshot of key results by section.
It focuses on how many issues remain in the proposed design and the changes in
scores between the existing situation and the proposed design.

2.20 The Results Further Analysis tab gives a full summary of the quantitative results of
the Route Check assessment, with some additional analysis. For example, you can
see how schemes score by mode of active travel.

2.21 The Results Export tab gives a full summary of both the qualitative and quantitative
results of the Route Check assessment, optimised for export into PDF file format.
