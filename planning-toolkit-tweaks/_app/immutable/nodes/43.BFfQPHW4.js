        supported by an effective wayfinding strategy, or</li> <li>residential or local streets encourage traffic movements through the
        site or are not designed for a 20mph speed limit (see Manual for Streets
        Section 7.4 for guidance on achieving appropriate traffic speeds)</li></ul> <p>There are gaps in the provision of well-located, on-site amenities to
