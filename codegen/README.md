# Code generation scripts

Manually copying dozens of scorecard questions from Excel isn't feasible, so these scripts automate that process. The CSV files are **not** intended to be edited later and the scripts re-run; the source of truth becomes the generated Svelte files. Those files are **manually edited** to adjust wording, add links, introduce formatting, etc. Everything is checked in here just for reference.

The CSV input files were made with LibreOffice, saving each sheet as a CSV with default options. Leading and trailing lines were manually deleted.

## Authority Name Handling
We also generate here a map from various aliases people use for local authorities. This was initially done because the list of authority names used in the spreadsheet version of this tool did not align with the officially sanctioned ATE names for authorities.

The inputs to this process are `/inputs/authority_aliases.csv` and `/inputs/original_list.csv`. The former can be acquired from the 'Authority alias to ONS region mapping' found on sharepoint. NB if you get a fresh version of this, do remove the authority ID column. The latter was taken from our code so if you want to update it you might want to append it from `src/lib/authority_names/authorityNameList.json`.

This allows us to validate and update files (either xlsx or json) generated by older versions of the tool, and update them to use the latest authority name list.
