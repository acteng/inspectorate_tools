# Code generation scripts

Manually copying dozens of scorecard questions from Excel isn't feasible, so these scripts automate that process. The CSV files are **not** intended to be edited later and the scripts re-run; the source of truth becomes the generated Svelte files. Those files are manually edited to introduce bold and underline formatting. Everything is checked in here just for reference.

The CSV input files were made with LibreOffice, saving each sheet as a CSV with default options. Leading and trailing lines were manually deleted.
