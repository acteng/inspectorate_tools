"Trip generation and assignment  ","Does the application appropriately forecast all day trips to, from and within the site by walking, wheeling and cycling?","Source data is not representative of the proposed development, is out-of-date or is confined to commuting journeys only.

Forecasted trip generation is limited to motor vehicle traffic or peak hours only.

Future year forecasts do not realise the potential of the development to support a greater number of walking, wheeling and cycling journeys or do not align with the government’s vision in Gear Change (or any adopted local targets) that half of all journeys in towns and cities shall be walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.","National Planning Policy Framework: 108, 114, 117;

"Active travel route audit ","Has an appropriate assessment on the design and accessibility of existing active travel routes in the locality of the site been presented?","Local pedestrian and cycling routes are only identified in application documents by their location, with no assessment provided on whether these are safe, direct, convenient and accessible for people of all abilities (paragraph 82 of the National Design Guide) or coherent, direct, safe, comfortable and attractive (core design principles in LTN 1/20).

Applications that include new dwellings have not demonstrated how local schools and colleges will be accessed by active travel modes.

Qualitative analysis to inform any necessary improvements to the design and accessibility of key routes does not include maps, photographs and comments nor has regard to the following guidance, tools and plans in the assessment of key routes:
• Inclusive Mobility (Chapters 3, 4, 6, 7 and 15; and Sections 5.2, 5.7, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.7 as appropriate)

"Pedestrian access to local amenities ","Are most buildings within 800m from a range of amenities (such as primary schools, parks, play areas, food shops, cafes and community buildings) using well-designed routes?","Trip lengths to key amenities as presented in application documents are based on straight-line distances from site boundaries or main access points.

There are few everyday amenities within the recommended distance from most buildings using safe and accessible routes for pedestrians.

Footpaths/ways to local amenities do not conform to the National Design Guide standards of being safe, direct, convenient and accessible for people of all abilities, which includes but is not limited to routes that:
• have a minimum width of 2m, with limited pinch points no less than 1.5m
• are step-free
• have a smooth, even surface
• have seating at regular intervals
• are uncluttered
• have good natural surveillance and clear lines of sight
• have street lighting
• have wayfinding, and
• have crossing points suitable for the speed and traffic flow of the road(s)","National Planning Policy Framework: 8, 74, 87, 96, 97, 108, 112, 114, 116;

"Cycling accessibility ","Are a range of local amenities, and town centres, railway stations, employment areas and the National Cycle Network as appropriate, accessible for cyclists using well-designed routes?","Cycle routes relied on by the development are not coherent, direct, safe, comfortable or attractive in line with the five core design principles and geometric requirements in LTN 1/20 (see Sections 4.2 and 5). This may be due to physical features, steps, steep gradients or surface quality; or the absence of ramps, lighting or appropriate crossing facilities.

The development relies on shared use routes in full or intermittently, which conflict with the government’s clear position in Gear Change (p. 17, 21 and 41) and paragraph 1.6.1 (2) in LTN 1/20 that cycles must be treated as vehicles and not as pedestrians.

There is insufficient protection from motor traffic in accordance with the suitability and segregation standards in LTN 1/20 (see Figure 4.1 and Section 6) such that some potential cyclists would be excluded.","National Planning Policy Framework: 8, 74, 87, 96, 97, 108, 112, 114, 116;

"Access to public transport ","Are all buildings within 400m of a high-frequency bus stop or 800m of a rail station, with appropriate facilities, using well-designed routes?","There are no public transport nodes with a regular service (this will differ between urban and rural areas) within the recommended distances.

Local bus stops do not have good natural surveillance or do not provide seating, lighting, shelter, real-time passenger information and raised bus boarders or specialist kerbs. Local rail stations do not provide sufficient cycle parking, including spaces for non-standard cycles.

Footpaths/ways to public transport nodes do not conform to the National Design Guide standards of being safe, direct, convenient and accessible for people of all abilities, which includes but is not limited to routes that:
• have a minimum width of 2m, with limited pinch points no less than 1.5m
• are step-free
• have a smooth, even surface

"Off-site transport infrastructure ","Does the application include proposals to enhance local active travel and public transport infrastructure?","The application fails to identify necessary, directly related and proportionate improvements or contributions to:
• footpaths/ways in line with the design standards identified in criteria 3 and 5
• cycling routes in line with LTN 1/20 standards identified in criteria 4, or
• public transport infrastructure (where this is not provided on-site) that may include: new or extended services; seating, lighting, shelter, real-time passenger information and raised bus boarders or specialist kerbs at bus stops; and secure cycle parking with pumps and repair tools at rail stations and mobility hubs

The application fails to identify the mechanism to secure identified improvements and the trigger point(s) for delivery or payment.

Proposed road/junction improvements do not prioritise pedestrian and cycling movements, including appropriate crossings.","National Planning Policy Framework: 108, 112, 114, 116;

"
"Site permeability ","Does the development prioritise pedestrian and cycle movements within the site?","Opportunities have been missed to maximise accessibility for active travel modes, including:
• the development does not provide or safeguard pedestrian and cycling connections to neighbouring sites including future phases of development
• routes for pedestrians and cyclists are not at least as direct – and preferably more direct – than the equivalent by car
• routes are not fully accessible or do not have adjacent accessible alternatives (e.g. ramps alongside steps or bound paths next to unbound paths)
• inappropriate or infrequent crossings are proposed (see Inclusive Mobility Sections 4.10-4.11, PAS 6463 Section 7.6.2, LTN 1/20 Table 10-2, Manual for Streets Section 6.3 and Manual for Steets 2 Section 9.3)
• pedestrians and cyclists are not prioritised at side road crossing points (see LTN 1/20 Figure 10.13)
• priority junctions have radii that interrupts the pedestrian desire line (see Manual for Streets Sections 6.3-6.4 and Manual for Streets 2 Section 9.4)
• there are red/zero scores when applying the Junction Assessment Tool in LTN 1/20
• signalised junctions do not have pedestrian aspects on some arms
• where cyclists would mix with motor vehicles, lane widths are between 3.2m and 3.9m (paragraph 7.2.5 of LTN 1/20 identifies that such widths allow motor vehicles to drive alongside a cyclist without a safety margin for their comfort and protection)
• there are unsafe transitions for cyclists when moving between cycleways on and off the carriageway, or
• cycleways within commercial sites are not continuous through to cycle parking areas

Shared use routes for pedestrians and cyclists are proposed and these do not meet the limited situations listed in paragraph 6.5.6 of LTN 1/20. Where shared use routes are acceptable, their widths are below 3m (<300 cyclists per hour) or below 4.5m elsewhere, contrary to LTN 1/20 Table 6-3.","National Planning Policy Framework: 96, 108, 114, 116;

"Placemaking ","Does the development establish a strong sense of place, with well-designed streets, public spaces that feel safe and key amenities provided?","The design of streets does not encourage social interaction or create attractive, safe and accessible open spaces that would support an active life for everyone, contrary to the National Design Guide (See Part 2). This may include missed opportunities to incorporate green infrastructure / street trees, shared space residential streets (such as appropriately designed home-zones, mews and culs-de-sac), equipped play facilities, seating at regular intervals, and clear lines of sight to assist with orientation (including measures to prevent inconsiderate parking).

Aspects of the proposed design give rise to personal and highway safety concerns, including:
• streets, public transport nodes and other public spaces do not benefit from appropriate levels of natural surveillance and lighting
• the requirements of disabled people have not been appropriately considered
• the development includes 'blind-spots', sharp turns or high-sided boundary treatments
• the development does not provide continuous and legible routes or is not supported by an effective wayfinding strategy, or
• residential or local streets encourage traffic movements through the site or are not designed for a 20mph speed limit (see Manual for Streets Section 7.4 for guidance on achieving appropriate traffic speeds)

There are gaps in the provision of well-located, on-site amenities to support the quantum of development proposed, in conflict with paragraph 83 of the National Design Guide. For larger residential-led developments, this may include a lack of evidence that the applicant has utilised local authority pupil yield data (or the Department for Education’s Pupil Yield Dashboard in the absence of such) to inform the need for new schools and early years settings.","National Planning Policy Framework: 8, 74, 87, 96, 97, 99, 108, 114, 116, 135, 136;

"Cycle parking and trip-end facilities ","Does the application provide the requisite amount and quality of cycle parking and trip-end facilities?","Cycle parking is not provided in accordance with up-to-date local standards, or Section 11 of LTN 1/20 in the absence of such. Details of accessibility, parking types and dimensions, security arrangements or lighting as appropriate is not provided (highly accessible cycle parking is essential for people with sensory and/or information processing differences and disabled cyclists who may be unable to walk very far or navigate a change in levels).

For workplaces, public buildings (including those used for leisure and recreation) larger retail developments and other developments with communal parking: 
• internal cycle stores cannot be accessed from building frontages, are not step-free or require passing through more than two sets of doors
• a proportion of cycle parking (typically 5%) is not provided for non-standard cycles to accommodate people with mobility impairments, which is contrary to paragraph 11.3.2 of LTN 1/20 (Table 11-2 also advises on bay lengths and access aisle widths for larger cycles using Sheffield stands), or
• high-quality facilities including showers, lockers, changing rooms and drying areas are not provided for cyclists in non-residential settings (see Section 11.7 of LTN 1/20, BREEAM guidance and any local standards)

The quantum and quality of the cycle parking and trip-end facilities proposed does not align with travel plan targets for cycling or application objectives to deliver a sustainable form of development.","National Planning Policy Framework: 114, 116;

"Travel planning ","Does the travel plan outline ambitious mode share targets and measures to embed active travel, alongside appropriate monitoring and remedial strategies?","A ‘full’, ‘framework’ or ‘interim’ travel plan has not been submitted as appropriate (a framework travel plan is generally only appropriate for commercial developments where the end user is unknown, while an interim travel plan can be acceptable where the split of uses is not yet confirmed).

Where the appropriate travel plan has been submitted:
• targets for active travel mode share lack ambition or do not align with the government’s vision in Gear Change (or any adopted local targets) that half of all journeys in towns and cities shall be walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.
• there is an absence of travel plan targets for all uses proposed within the application site as appropriate
• the travel plan does not provide sufficient detail on the active travel and public transport infrastructure to be provided or improved (both on and off-site) or how its use will be embedded by initiatives and incentives to be secured through planning conditions and obligations, or
• there are no details of effective and influential actions to be taken if targets are not met, with the intention for these to be secured and monitored (if triggered) through planning conditions and obligations","National Planning Policy Framework: 114, 117;
