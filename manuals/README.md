This folder contains files related to the content of the manuals. These are stored as .md files generated by inputting the existing manuals from: [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/active-travel-england-design-assistance-tools) and [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/active-travel-england-scheme-review-tools) into [a tool for converting PDFs into MD](https://pdf2md.morethan.io/).

Git history will record edits made to these files (`area-check.md`, `cross-section.md`, `route-check.md`), and there also exists notes for each one to jot down changes throughout the file, or questions for the users/creators of the original tool. These are in `{tool-name}-notes.md`.
