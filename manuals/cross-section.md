## Route Cross-Section Tool User Manual

Publication date: February

All Active Travel England tools and user manuals will be reviewed regularly and updated
as needed.

## 1. Introduction

1.1 This user manual is a desktop guide for the Route Cross-Section Tool. The tool is a
‘design assistance’ tool, created to show the user what infrastructure may be possible
along a highway corridor in terms of available width. The tool lets users test different
hypothetical cross-sections and provides guidance on what infrastructure is desirable
as well as highlighting important issues. The tool aligns with current national guidance,
sign-posting users to relevant passages in LTN 1/20^1 , Inclusive Mobility^2 and The
Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB)^3 as appropriate.

1.2 The Route Cross-Section Tool can be used at any stage of the design process for
highway corridor projects but it is most useful in the pre-feasibility/concept stages.
It shows the user how to design high-quality walking, wheeling and cycling
infrastructure for the widest-possible range of street users, including people with
disabilities, within the constraints of the available space. It can be used alongside
ATE’s Route Check tool to help designers and other transport professionals find
ways of maximising design quality and service levels within the available space.
Values used in the Route Cross-Section Tool (such as minimum footway widths)
are consistent with those used in the Route Check tool.

1.3 This tool is not suitable for assessing area-wide schemes, school streets, cycle parking
or networks of routes.

1.4 First and foremost, the tool is a design aid, rooted in best practice, to help users
provide infrastructure in line with the latest national guidance. It is not an audit, and it
does not give answers, and while it is comprehensive, it may not cover all possible
eventualities and contexts. It is the responsibility of the scheme designer to be familiar
with the relevant design codes and work out the most suitable options that balance
all the needs of a street.

## 3. Summary of Scheme

3 .1 It is important that you fill in the Summary of Scheme section to make sure there is a
complete and accurate record of key scheme information. You should fill in all the
Summary of Scheme tab fields before moving on to the next section. If you do not have
some of this information, you can get in touch with a relevant member of ATE’s
Regional Management team.

3.2 The fields in the first table in the Summary of Scheme tab are as follows:

- Scheme Reference – the relevant funding programme scheme reference, where
    applicable.
- Scheme Name – the scheme name according to the funding programme.
- Scheme Summary – use to provide a brief description of the scheme including
    any relevant programme-level information.
- Authority – the provisioning authority for the scheme.
- Transport/Combined Authority – the combined authority, where the scheme falls
    under a combined authority area.
- Region – the part of England where the scheme is located. There are also options
    for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
- Funding Programme – the main funding source for the scheme.
- Design Stage – the current design stage of the scheme.
- Funding Conditions – any specific conditions regarding infrastructure attached to
    the relevant funding programme.
- Route Length Assessed in this File (km) – the length of route assessed in the
    specific Excel tool copy.
- Total Route Length (km) – where the scheme is part of a longer scheme,
    assessed over multiple Excel tool copies.
- Notes is a space for the user to add any other relevant notes on the scheme.

3.3 After filling the above details, you should sketch the route on a  map. At the bottom of this summary section there is a map and a link to our [Scheme Sketcher](https://acteng.github.io/atip/?style=streets#6.06/53.021/-1.825). You can use  our scheme sketcher to sketch your route, then download the file and upload it into the cross-section tool. This sketch will be used later in the process when considering pinch points along the route.

## 4. Proposed Cross-Sections

4 .1 In this section, you will enter contextual information to work out what types of infrastructure
are suitable for the locations you are assessing. You can build different cross-sections
to standards and test them to see if they fit the available space.

4.2 You must start by adding the data asked for in the ‘Traffic data and additional
information’ table. These inputs are mandatory, and the tool will not work if all the
relevant fields are not populated. In future versions we will make it optional to fill in information about unused lane types. E.g. if you are only proposing 1-way cycle tracks, you will not need to fill in `Expected peak hour cycle flow: 2-way cycle tracks`.

4.3 Next, you will create a preferred cross-section as follows:

```
a. You can then build the proposed cross-section. Use the `Add feature` button to add a new feature to you cross section.
```

```
b. Each feature in your cross-section will be represented by aa card with a drop down to select the feature type, a delete button to remove it, and left/right arrows to move the feature around in your cross section.
```
- see Appendix A for these and any important points to note. As you start to work
through this, the following information might be displayed to you with hyperlinks where appropriate:
    - links to references in the relevant guidance e.g., LTN 1/20 and a brief
       summary;
    - suggested considerations where the proposed cross-section does not comply
       with guidance; and
    - desirable minimum widths for each feature, based on the relevant guidance.

```
c. As you add features you will see the desirable and absolute minimum width of your cross  section displayed above it. 
```

```
d. You can add extra items for any feature types that are not covered in the
preset options (see Figure 5) in the ‘Custom Street Features’ section. These custom
features will then appear in the dropdown lists. Any spare width highlighted
as available by the tool could be used for features such as rain gardens and other
sustainable drainage features, benches and resting places, additional planting and/or
trees. Adding these to the street improves the Placemaking score in ATE’s separate
Route Check tool. The names you give these custom features must not be the same
as any of the existing options in the dropdown menus for `Street feature type`.
```

```
e. If the required width is greater than that available on your route you will have to redesign which features you include. If there are some places with insufficient width you can design a 'Compromised Cross-section' which requires less width. There is  a section beneath `Preferred Cross-Section` for this, which you can populate with a copy of your preferred cross-section using the `Copy Preferred` button.
```

4.4 If either the desirable minimum or absolute minimum cross-sections include shared-
use cycle tracks, the tool will remind you that you will need to justify this in light of
LTN 1/20 guidance.

## 5. Cross-Sections Check

5 .1 This section allows you to mark points along your route where you've measured the available width. It will  tell you for each of these 'pinch points' whether you can build the preferred or compromised cross-sections.

5.2 A cross-section deliverability test should be completed:

- Once for every homogenous section of route, where the total available width and
    the proposed features are the same.
- At every ‘pinch point’ where there is less available width, and at every atypical
    section along the route, to make sure that every challenging location is tested.

5.3 To complete this section, you should measure the available width for each
homogenous section of route where the width stays similar and enter these values in
row. Add a new section using the `Add` button beneath `Checking possible cross-sections of homogeneous sections of route along the proposed corridor`, then simply add the available width for that homogenous section.

5.4 You should be as accurate as possible with every measurement you enter in the tool,
as confidence in the output of the Route Cross-Section Tool depends on the quality
of the measurements you put into it.

5.6 You now need to locate any pinch-points or atypical sections of the route and repeat
the exercise described above, to check which cross-sections are possible at more
constrained or challenging places along the route. Underneath `Checking possible cross-sections of any constrained or atypical locations along the proposed corridor` is a map showing the sketch you  uploaded earlier. Simply click on the map to add a pinch point. Pinch points can be dragged around the map to change their location if needed.

5.8 For any locations where the cross-section does not fit the available width you must then provide a description of what would need to change in
order to fit the infrastructure in and what, if anything, could change in order to fit a
more suitable cross-section there.

5.9 When considering alternative arrangements, you must make sure that schemes
implementing cycling infrastructure do not compromise pedestrian facilities
unacceptably. Wherever you propose shared-use cycle tracks in cross-sections,
the tool will remind you to justify these against LTN 1/20 guidance. Shared-use cycle
tracks are not suitable for many locations and contexts and should only ever be a
last resort when all other possible options have been considered and evidenced
as undeliverable.


## Appendix A – List of Preset Options in

## the Proposed Cross-Sections tab

```
Preset option Notes
```
```
Footway
```
```
Preset width will vary with street function (Cell E10) to account
for scenarios with higher pedestrian traffic. Test pedestrian
comfort level with ATE’s Route Check tool.
```
```
Narrow traffic/
bus lane
```
```
Where conditions are favourable, cycling in mixed traffic on the
carriageway may be an option. The tool highlights where
speed and traffic volumes will not suit most cyclists, according
to Table 4-2 of LTN 1/20.
```
```
Wide traffic/
bus lane
```
```
Where conditions are favourable, cycling in mixed traffic on the
carriageway may be an option. The tool highlights where
speed and traffic volumes will not suit most cyclists, according
to Table 4-2 of LTN 1/20.
```
```

```
```
Where conditions are favourable, cycling in mixed traffic on the
carriageway may be an option. The tool highlights where
speed and traffic volumes will not suit most cyclists, according
to Table 4-2 of LTN 1/20.
```
```
On-highway

```
The tool highlights where speed and traffic volumes will mean
that this provision will not suit most cyclists, according to Table
4-2 of LTN 1/20.
```
```
1-way protected
cycle track
```
```
The width needed is taken from Table 5-2 in LTN 1/20 with an
extra 0.3m added to allow for the minimum width needed to
accommodate protection to the track (2 back-to-back kerbs,
light segregation, etc). If you need an extra buffer to a traffic
lane and width is very constrained, this extra 0.3m can be
taken off the buffer width: use Custom Street Features to
create a custom-width buffer.
```
```
2-way protected
cycle track
