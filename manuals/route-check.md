All Active Travel England tools and user manuals will be reviewed regularly and updated
as needed.

1. Introduction

1.1 This user manual is a desktop guide for the Route Check. The tool is a ‘scheme
review’ tool used for assessing the design quality of linear street or path schemes.
This tool can be used in both urban and rural contexts. It is similar in style to the
‘Cycling Level of Service’^1 and ‘Healthy Streets Check for Designers’^2 tools released
by the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL). This user
manual allows you to assess and score streets and paths against various metrics
under the categories of safety, accessibility, comfort, directness, attractiveness and
cohesion. However, unlike the ‘Cycling Level of Service’ tool, it also accounts for the
user experience of people walking and wheeling, including people with disabilities.

1.2 The Route Check is used by ATE for assessing the design quality of linear schemes.
However, it may also be used by local authorities and others wishing to assess the
design quality of schemes against ATE’s quality criteria.

1.3 When ATE uses the Route Check to assess the design quality of active travel
infrastructure, the main goal is not to pass or fail schemes. Rather, its primary purpose
is to remind designers of key active travel policies, promote best practice and prompt
discussions about design solutions.

1.4 The Route Check is also intended for use throughout the scheme design process,
meaning that you can identify critical issues and other problems at the feasibility stage
and design them out in later stages before construction.

1.5 This document is divided into 13 chapters. The next chapter is an overview of the
Route Check tool’s structure, and subsequent chapters (3–13) give more information
on each different section of the tool (see Figure 1).

2 [TfL Health Streeets](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets)

1.6 The Route Check tool includes a Policy Check section (described in Chapter 4) and
accompanying Policy Conflict Log (described in Chapter 5). In these sections of the
Route Check, you can assess schemes against six active travel policy principles and
log any instances of policy conflicts. These six principles, derived from Inclusive
Mobility, LTN 1/20 and Gear Change, are key to making sure that active travel
schemes are inclusive for everyone walking, wheeling and cycling, including people
with disabilities.

1.7 Chapter 6 introduces the Safety Check section, where you can score the scheme
against 16 safety metrics and check for the presence of safety-related critical issues.
You can then log any critical issues you find in the Critical Issues Log, which is dealt
with in Chapter 7.

1.8 When assessing a street-based scheme, you must fill in the Street Check (introduced
in Chapter 8) and the Street Placemaking Scheme (introduced in Chapter 9). When
assessing a traffic-free path, you must fill in the Path Check (introduced in Chapter 10)
and the Path Placemaking Check (introduced in Chapter 11).

1.9 The Route Check also introduces a new version of the Junction Assessment Tool
(JAT), a framework for assessing pedestrian and cycle movements at junctions. LTN
1/20 introduced a version of the JAT nationally, but that version of the JAT only covered
cycle movements at junctions. The Route Check introduces an expanded version of
this framework, which also accounts for pedestrian movements. You must assess and
score cyclist and pedestrian movements on certain types of junction along the route.
You can find more information on this section, including which junction types must be
assessed in the JAT, in Chapter 12.

1.10 Chapter 13 introduces the Results sections and explains how to interpret results and what
might happen after a Route Check has been completed. It also contains information
on how the Route Check calculates scores.


2. Route Check Structure

2.1 The Route Check organises the design assessment process into different sections which can be accessed via a contents page. These sections are divided into input sections and
output sections. Some input sections are mandatory, and others are optional. Every section
corresponds to a chapter in this user manual.

2.2 The input and output secttions are summarised in Figure 2 below, which shows them in the
order they appear in the spreadsheet, as well as which sections are optional depending on
whether a street or path is being assessed. Which sections are displayed to you and required are handled by the app, depending on how you fill out the `Summary of Scheme` section. 

2.3 This chapter explains these sections in more detail.

Input sections

2.4 The first four sections are all mandatory input sections (Figure 3). These must be completed regardless of whether your scheme is based on streets or
traffic-free paths.


2.5 The Summary of Scheme section must be completed. Here, you fill in details of the
scheme such as its name, length, design stage and wider network context. It is
also traffic-free paths. It is highly important that you select this correctly as it affects
how the spreadsheet works. More information can be found in Chapter 3 of this
user manual.

2.6 The Policy Check section asks you to answer six questions about how well the existing
situation and proposed design align with six active travel policy principles. You must
complete this section for all schemes. You can find more information in Chapter 4 of this
user manual. All Route Check questions and metrics have a unique code which
references the relevant section of the tool. The ‘PO’ prefix is used for the six Policy
Check questions (PO01–PO06).

2.7 Each existing policy conflict as well as any thrown up by the proposed scheme design must be mapped using the `Problems Mapping Page`.
This section is separate from the Policy Check because there may be multiple instances of the same
policy conflict on the same route. You must log each of these individually, with locaation information captured by dropping a pin on the map. If there are no policy conflicts in the existing scheme or
design, you can leave this section blank. You can find more information on the Policy
Conflict Log section of the tool in Chapter 5 of this user manual.

2.8 In the Safety Check section, you must assess and score the existing situation and
proposed design against 16 safety metrics, each of which could potentially score as a
‘critical issue’. This section must be completed for all types of scheme. Some safety
metrics may be less applicable to traffic-free path schemes. If this is the case, you can
choose ‘not applicable’ as your answer if the metric doesn’t apply. The SA prefix is
used for the 16 Safety Check metrics (SA01–SA16). You can find more information
on the Safety Check in Chapter 6 of this user manual.

2.9 Every critical issue present
in the existing situation as well as in the proposed scheme design must be mapped, again using the `Problems Mapping Page`. This section is
separate from the Safety Check because there may be multiple instances of the same
safety conflict on the same route. You must log each of these individually, adding
location and other information. If there are no critical issues in the existing scheme or
design, you can leave this section blank. You can find more information on the Critical
Issues Log section of the tool in Chapter 7.

2.10 The next two Route Check sections are also input sections. You will be able to and must complete
them if the scheme is based on a street.

2.11 The Street Check section asks you to assess and score the existing situation and
proposed scheme design against 26 metrics categorised under accessibility, comfort,
directness, attractiveness and cohesion. You must complete this section for all street-
based schemes. The ST prefix is used for the 26 Street Check metrics (ST17–ST42).
You can find more information in Chapter 8 of this user manual.

2.12 The Street Placemaking section asks you to assess and score the existing situation and
proposed scheme design against 26 street placemaking metrics, categorised under
social activity, personal security, character and legibility and the environment. The SP
prefix is used for the 26 Street Placemaking Check metrics (SP1–SP26). You can
find more information in Chapter 9 of this user manual.

2.13 The next two Route Check sections are also input sections. You will be able to and must complete
them if the scheme is based on a traffic-free path.

2.14 The Path Check section asks you to assess and score the existing situation and
proposed scheme design against 30 metrics categorised under accessibility, comfort,
directness, attractiveness and cohesion. This section must be completed for all schemes
based on traffic-free paths. The PA prefix is used for the 30 Path Check metrics
(PA17– PA46). You can find more information in Chapter 10.

2.15 The Path Placemaking Check section asks you to assess and score the existing
situation and proposed scheme design against 19 path placemaking metrics,
categorised under social activity, personal security, character and legibility, and the
environment. The PP prefix is used for the 19 Path Placemaking Check metrics
(PP01–PP19). You can find more information in Chapter 11 of this user manual.

2.16 The final input section in Route Check is the JAT Check section, which must be
completed if there are specific junction types along the route, regardless of whether
the scheme is based on streets or traffic-free paths. The JAT Check section contains the
Junction Assessment Tool Check, which asks you to assess and score pedestrian and
cycle movements at certain types of junction for both the existing situation and
proposed scheme design. You must complete the JAT Check if the scheme has any of
these types of junctions. You can find more information on the JAT Check, including
which junction types you must assess and score, in Chapter 12.

2.17 It sometimes happens that while you are filling in the later sections in Route Check and
getting into the design details, you may reconsider scores in the earlier sections, or notice
extra policy conflicts or critical issues that you did not log previously. You can always
go back to earlier sections and amend or add to them.

Output sections

2.18 The final three sections are all output sections, give the results of the Route Check assessments in three different forms.
You can find more information on these sections in Chapter 13.

2.19 The Results Summary section gives a concise snapshot of key results by section.
It focuses on how many issues remain in the proposed design and the changes in
scores between the existing situation and the proposed design.

2.20 The Results Further Analysis section gives a full summary of the quantitative results of
the Route Check assessment, with some additional analysis. For example, you can
see how schemes score by mode of active travel.

2.21 The Results Export section gives a full summary of both the qualitative and quantitative
results of the Route Check assessment, optimised for export into PDF file format.


3. Summary of Scheme

3 .1 The Summary of Scheme section is where you fill in scheme details like its name, length,
type (street or path), design stage and wider network context.

3.2 It has three sub-sections:

```
A. Summary of Scheme, which you must fill in with as much information as
possible to ensure a complete and accurate record of the key scheme information.
For example, if the scheme forms part of a funding bid and ATE are reviewing it,
then inputs such as ‘scheme information reviewed’ and ‘design stage’ will be
important for tracking the scheme through the funding bid process.
B. Route Check Type (Street or Path), which must be answered for you to be presented with the correct sections.
C. Network Map, which you must fill in to allow the scheme to be located and
defined in its wider context.
```
Summary of Scheme

3.3 You should populate as many of the fields in the Summary of Scheme table as you can
before moving on. If you don’t have some of this information, you can contact the
relevant member of ATE’s Regional Management team for it.

3.4 The fields in the first table in the Summary of Scheme section are as follows:

- Date of Design Review is for the date (or dates) over which the design
    review took place.
- Scheme Reference is for the relevant funding programme scheme reference,
    if applicable.
- Scheme Name means the name of the scheme according to the funding
    programme.
- Scheme Summary can be used to give a brief description of the scheme,
    including any relevant programme-level information.
- Scheme Information Reviewed is where you should give information about
    the documents the review is based on. For example, if a General Arrangement
    drawing has been reviewed, you should enter details here.
- Authority means the provisioning authority for the scheme.
- Transport/Combined Authority means the combined authority, if the
    scheme is in a combined authority area.
- Region is the part of England where the scheme is located. There are also
    options for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
- Funding Programme means the main funding source for the scheme.
- Design Stage is the current design stage of the scheme.
- Funding Conditions are any conditions on infrastructure attached to the
    relevant funding programme.
- Inspector Email Address means the email address of the ATE inspector
    who completed the design review. If someone outside of ATE completed the
    spreadsheet, then you should leave this section blank, and put details in the
    ‘Notes’ field.
- Route Length Assessed in this File (km) is where you should enter the
    length of route being assessed in the file in kilometres.
- Total Route Length (km) is where you can enter the total length of the
    scheme, if the route is too long and varied to assess in a single Route
    Check file.
- Notes is a space where you can add any other relevant notes on the scheme
    or design review.

3.5 The reason for these two separate route length inputs is that sometimes longer
corridor schemes may need to be split up into smaller sections for assessment.
We recommend you do this if there is a big change in the characteristics of the street
(for example, if a route goes from a quiet residential street onto a busy dual
carriageway). However, in many cases, it will be possible and preferable to assess the
entire route in a single file. In such cases, the length you enter in the boxes for Route
length assessed in this file (km) and Total route length (km) will be the same.

Route Check Type (Street or Path)

3.6 Once you have filled in all the relevant boxes in the Summary of Scheme table, you
can move on to the Route Check Type (Street or Path). Here, you will be asked
whether the scheme you are reviewing is on a street (i.e. mixed with or next to motor
traffic for most of its length) or on a traffic-free path. If the scheme is on a street, you
should choose the Street Check option. If the scheme is on a traffic-free path, you
should choose Path Check.

Network Map

3.7 Finally, the Network Map section will ask you for information on the location and
context of the scheme.

3.8 First you should use scheme sketcher tool, which is linked, to sketch the route. Then download it and load the downloaded file into the route check tool.

3.9 Your route will then be displayed on the map so you can check the sketch has been transferred succesfully.


4. Policy Check

4 .1 This section of the Route Check asks you to assess schemes against six active travel
policy principles taken from Inclusive Mobility, LTN 1/20 and Gear Change. Following
these principles helps make sure that routes are suitable for everyone walking,
wheeling, and cycling, including people with disabilities. The policy principles are
formulated as six questions:

```
PO01. Are cyclists separated from pedestrians?
```
```
PO02. Is the route free from barriers, such as chicane barriers, steps or dismount
signs?
```
```
PO03. Does the route feel direct, logical and intuitive to understand for all road
users?
```
```
PO04. Are surfaces suitable for all users?
PO05. Is appropriate lighting provided?
```
```
PO06. Does the route join together, or join other facilities together, as part of a
holistic, connected network?
```
4.2 The themes these policy principles address reoccur in metrics in other sections of the
Route Check. For example, metric ST38 in the Street Check is about shared-use cycle
tracks and toucan crossings and goes into more detail about the first policy principle
on whether cyclists are separated from pedestrians. However, as these six policy
principles are key to making sure that active travel schemes are inclusive for all people
walking, wheeling and cycling, they are given greater prominence in the Route Check
by including them in a dedicated section at the front end of the tool.

4.3 ATE selected these six policy principles from Inclusive Mobility, LTN 1/20 and Gear
Change based on recurring problems seen in schemes submitted to ATE in its first
year. They are particularly relevant to the needs of people walking and wheeling,
including people with disabilities. You can find more information on this in the sub-
sections of this chapter below.

4.4 The Policy Check section of the Route Check consists of a simple table. The first two
columns contain the policy principle number and policy principle as a question. You
must answer these questions in the third column for the existing situation on the street
or path by choosing ‘yes’ or ‘no’. You must then answer these questions again in the
fourth column, this time for the design proposal. You should add a comment in the last
column to explain your answers.

4.5 The aim is for the proposed design to comply with all six policy principles, and be able
to enter ‘yes’ in all the rows in the fourth column. Anywhere you have answered ‘no’ is
considered a policy conflict. You must also log every policy conflict in the Policy
Conflict Log section of the Route Check (see Chapter 5). Whenever a policy conflict
appears in your design, you should think about how you might redesign the scheme to
achieve compliance. In cases where ATE is involved with reviewing the scheme, policy
conflicts will be discussed during correspondence and meetings. Wherever possible,


```
ATE will provide local authorities with design advice on how to achieve compliance
with the policy principles.
```
4.6 In some cases, you may not be able to achieve compliance with all six policy
principles. While this is not ideal, it may be acceptable in certain contexts. Please also
note that, in some cases, failing to comply with certain policy principles may mean that
the scheme does not meet certain requirements under the Equality Act (2010).

4.7 The next sections of this chapter discuss the six policy principles in more detail.

Are cyclists separated from pedestrians? (PO01)

4.8 A key design principle listed on page 21 of Gear Change is that “cyclists must be
separated from pedestrians”. LTN 1/20 builds on this on pages 9 and 67 and states
that “in general, shared use facilities in streets with high pedestrian or cyclist flows
should not be used and in urban areas the conversion of a footway to shared use
should be regarded as a last resort”.

4.9 Shared-use provision affects the attractiveness and desirability of the route, particularly
for pedestrians and people with disabilities. If the scheme design does not comply
with this policy principle, you should use the commentary column to give a summary
of how you have considered the guidance in LTN 1/20.

Is the route free from barriers, such as chicane barriers, steps

or dismount signs? (PO02)

4 .10 Another key design principle listed on page 21 of Gear Change is that “barriers, such
as chicane barriers and dismount signs, should be avoided”. These kinds of features
make routes inaccessible for a large range of potential users, especially people with
disabilities, in terms of walking, wheeling and cycling. LTN 1/20 builds on this on
pages 9 and 12, and on page 30 it gives steps as an example of a feature that does
not meet accessibility standards in certain contexts. Steps are therefore included in
this policy principle.

4 .11 In line with the above, schemes to allow all forms of active travel should seek to
remove barriers wherever possible to allow more destinations to be served by the
walking, wheeling and cycling network. If you are considering barriers either for
retention or installation as part of a design, this will be picked up in the Policy Check
and taken forward as a discussion point. ATE will help local authorities find design
solutions for removing such barriers wherever possible.

Does the route feel direct, logical and intuitive to understand

for all road users? (PO03)

4 .12 Another key design principle listed on page 21 of Gear Change is that “routes must
feel direct, logical and be intuitively understandable by all road users”. Anyone
choosing to walk, wheel or cycle, including people with disabilities, must be confident
and clear about how any part of a route links into a coherent whole. If people trust the


```
network to get them to their destination, they are more likely to choose to walk, wheel
or cycle.
```
4 .13 Routes for people walking, wheeling and cycling should be direct and not involve
unnecessary and difficult turns, especially for people in wheelchairs, on cycles or on
horses. This applies to the route as a whole and to desire lines at junctions and
crossings.

4 .14 The needs of neurodiverse people walking, wheeling and cycling should also be
considered as part of this policy check. The British Standards Institution’s Designing
for the Mind guide provides information on how to consider the needs of such users.

Are surfaces suitable for all users? (PO04)

4 .15 Paragraph 8.1.2 of LTN 1/20 states that “for year-round utility cycling, a sealed
surface is necessary”, and that “loose gravel surfaces can be difficult or inaccessible
for people in wheelchairs and some types of adapted cycle”. ATE’s main objectives
relate to year-round utility trips and therefore a sealed surface is the surfacing
standard expected.

4 .16 Sealed walking, wheeling and cycling surfaces help make sure that routes are
accessible, attractive and safe all year round for anyone choosing to walk, wheel and
cycle. If a design proposes an unsealed, unbound surface, this will be picked up in the
Policy Check and elsewhere in the tool, and taken forward as a discussion point. ATE
will help local authorities find design solutions for such surfacing issues wherever
possible.

Is appropriate lighting provided? (PO05)

4 .17 Paragraph 8.1.2 of LTN 1/20 states that “for year-round utility cycling... street lighting
should be provided”. It is important that routes are lit if they are to be useable by the
full range of people walking, wheeling and cycling at all times of year, including people
with disabilities. Lighting is a very important factor for both safety and perceived safety.
Suitable lighting will help people see walking, wheeling and cycling routes as viable for
year-round travel, especially for more vulnerable user groups.

4 .18 On many routes, particularly on streets, it is likely that existing street lighting will be
satisfactory. However, extra lighting or improvements may still be necessary.

4 .19 Routes away from lit streets may need dedicated lighting installed to become useable.
It is important, however, that you do not then create ‘black spots’ or shadows which
may become ‘ambush points’. There may be difficulties with lighting routes away from
streets due to a lack of electricity supply or environmental considerations. In some
cases, short stretches without lighting, or with solar-powered lighting, may be
considered appropriate and acceptable.

4.20 When considering this policy principle, you should take into account the needs of
everyone walking, wheeling and cycling, including people with disabilities. You should
also consider how this policy principle aligns with mode shift targets and whether


```
missing or uneven lighting is likely to dissuade people from walking, wheeling and
cycling. You should give a summary of the situation, your conclusions and how your
design meets this principle, in the commentary column.
```
Does the route join together, or join other facilities together,

as part of a holistic connected network? (PO06)

4.21 This policy principle comes from LTN 1/20 summary principle 8. Creating a holistic
connected network of active travel routes is a key part of rolling out high-quality
walking, wheeling and cycling infrastructure in line with local LCWIPs and national
ambitions. New infrastructure that connects to existing routes and desirable
destinations is more likely to be used and will return more benefits on investment.

4.22 Through the inclusion of this policy principle in the Policy Check, you are encouraged
to consider the wider network context of your scheme. Furthermore, it acts as a
prompt for a discussion with ATE on how to best link the route with other routes and
destinations.

## Route Check User Manual

5. Safety Check

5 .1 The Safety Check section in the Route Check prompts you to check for the presence
of 16 ‘critical issues’ by assessing and scoring schemes against 16 safety metrics.
A critical issue is defined as a street layout or condition associated with an increased
risk of collision for pedestrians and cyclists.

5.2 Using the Route Check, you can identify and remove any critical issues during the
design process, while also improving the general quality of schemes. This will help
reduce the risks of collisions for pedestrians and cyclists, while also improving other
important aspects of the walking, wheeling and cycling experience, such as comfort,
directness and accessibility.

5.3 You must assess the 16 Safety Check metrics on any street or path scheme. There are
four possible scores for each metric. You must mark each metric as ‘not applicable’ or
score it as either ‘C’ (to indicate a critical issue), ‘0’, ‘1’ or ‘2.’ Your score should reflect
the ‘rule of worst’, in that it should reflect the worst conditions on the route.

5.4 For example, you would score metric SA02 (Conflict at Roundabouts and Signal
Junctions) as follows:

- A roundabout/signal-controlled junction scores 2 points if all pedestrian and cyclist
    movements are separated from all motor traffic movements.
- A roundabout/signal-controlled junction scores 1 point if the main pedestrian and
    cyclist movements are separated from motor traffic movements.
- A roundabout/signal-controlled junction scores 0 points if there are main pedestrian
    and/or cyclist movements in conflict with motor traffic flows of under 2,500 vehicles
    per day.
- A roundabout/signal-controlled junction is considered to have a critical issue if there
    are over 2,500 vehicles per day cutting across main walking, wheeling or cycling
    streams.

5.5 The score for a street or path is the same as the score for its worst scoring
roundabout or signal-controlled junction.

5.6 The ‘rule of worst’ is a very important concept in the Route Check and should be
borne in mind when assessing every metric, especially safety metrics.

5.7 You must assess the scheme against the scoring criteria for each metric and enter a
score for both the existing situation and the design proposals. You should provide any
assumptions made (for example, if flows were estimated rather than measured) in the
comments/assumptions boxes. Entering comprehensive comments and information in
these boxes will help people reviewing the Safety Check to understand your
justifications for your original scores.

5.8 The Safety Check section does not allow recording multiple instances of the same critical
issue. You must enter every critical issue identified in the existing situation or proposed
design in the Critical Issues Log (see Chapter 7).


5.9 For example, excessive camber (>2.5%) on footways is a critical issue. If there are four
instances of an excessive camber on an existing footway, then you must enter ‘C’ in
the ‘Existing’ column for metric SA15 in the Safety Check, and create four entries in
the Critical Issues Log – one for each time the critical issue occurs.

5 .10 Critical issues are also known by the same names as their metrics in the Safety Check.
They are as follows:

```
SA01. Conflict at Side Roads and Priority Junctions
```
```
SA02. Conflict at Roundabouts and Signal Junctions
SA03. Lane Widths
```
```
SA04. Trip Hazards

SA05. Kerbside Activity
SA06. Provision of Crossings

```
```
SA13.SA13. Crossing Angle of Tram or Train Rails
SA14.SA14. Cycling Surface and Maintenance Defects
```
```
SA15.SA15. Walking/Wheeling Surface and Maintenance Defects
```
```
SA16.SA16. Guard Railing
```
5 .11 While you must consider all sixteen metrics when assessing a street or a path, some
metrics are less likely to apply in a path context (unless the path interfaces with the
road network). When reviewing a path, you can simply mark irrelevant metrics as ‘not
applicable’. On some streets, some metrics may not apply. For example, if there are no
signal crossings for pedestrians, metric 10 will not apply. Likewise, if there are no
interactions with trams on the route, metrics 12 and 13 will not apply.

5 .12 Five of the 16 safety metrics and their associated critical issues only apply to cycling,
while six only apply to walking and wheeling. The remaining five metrics apply to all
three modes. You can find information on which metrics apply to which modes in the
‘Mode’ column in the Route Check spreadsheet.


5 .13 People walking and wheeling sometimes have different needs. However, in the Route
Check, walking and wheeling are often assessed using the same metrics. ATE has
written these metrics in a way that aims to capture the needs of both modes, along
with those of people with disabilities. The same is true for metrics which aim to
capture the needs of cyclists, including the needs of cyclists with disabilities. Applying
the rule of worst to the full range of metrics in the Route Check ensures that the most
pertinent issues are identified for each user group.

5 .14 The need to focus on identifying and removing critical issues was introduced nationally
in Local Transport Note 1/20 for cycling, and regionally through approaches such as
London’s ‘Healthy Streets Check’ and Greater Manchester’s “Streets for All Check”,
which introduced walking, wheeling and placemaking metrics. The reason for the
focus on these 16 critical issues is that they have a stronger and more robust evidence
base than some of the more context-specific metrics also included in the Route Check
tool. Future ATE publications will set out this evidence base and provide further
guidance on how to identify and remove critical issues, with worked examples.



6. Policy Conflict Log

6 .1 If you identify any policy conflicts in the Policy Check (see Chapter 4), they must be entered on the `Problems Mapping Page`.

6.2 In the Policy Check, you are asked to assess the scheme (both the existing situation
and the proposed design) against six active travel policy principles. If any of these six
principles are not met across the length of the route, then you must record a policy
conflict. However, the Policy Check section does not record multiple instances of the same
policy conflict across a scheme.

6.3 For example, PO01 asks if cyclists are separated from pedestrians. If there are two
discrete sections of a route where its design asks cyclists and pedestrians to share the
same facilities, then this will not be captured in the Policy Check section.

6.4 Therefore, the Policy Conflict Log’s purpose is to record every instance of a policy
conflict.

6.5 When you fill in the Policy Check section, start with the existing street or path. Enter
every existing policy conflict in the Policy Conflict Log. Then check the whole length of
the street or path for every policy conflict, as the same policy conflict can appear
multiple times.

6.6 When you identify a policy conflict in the existing situation, you should select `Policy Conflict` under `Create new problems` then. click on the map at its location, and fill in the form, choosing `Existing` for `Stage`. Likewise when you are filling in conflicts for the designed scheme you should follow this but select `Design` for `Stage`. You must then give the location a name, and record whether it is resolved by the design.

In the Policy Check, you are asked to assess the scheme (both the existing situation and
the proposed design) against six active travel policy principles. If any of these six
principles are not met across the length of the route, then you must record a policy conflict.
However, the Policy Check section does not record multiple instances of the same policy
conflict across a scheme.

For example, PO01 asks if cyclists are separated from pedestrians. If there are two
discrete sections of a route where its design asks cyclists and pedestrians to share the
same facilities, then this will not be captured in the Policy Check section.

6.7 The point at which one instance of a policy conflict ends and another begins can be
ambiguous. You should follow the guidance below when identifying discrete policy
conflicts and logging their locations:

- PO01 (Are cyclists separated from pedestrians?)
    - • You should log each continuous section of shared use facilities (e.g., a shared
       use cycle track and/or toucan crossing) individually.
    - • For example, if a route has a section where a shared use cycle track on one
       side of the street connects with another shared use cycle track on the other
       side of the street via a toucan crossing, this would be logged once as the
       shared use facilities are continuous. However, if there is a shared use cycle
       track that transitions into separate pedestrian and cycle facilities and then
       back into a shared use cycle track again, this would be logged twice.
    - • As sections of shared-use facilities cannot easily be represented by points, you
       can pick any latitude and longitude point as long as it is on the facility. The
       location name should describe the full facility in more detail.
- PO02 (Is the route free from barriers, such as chicane barriers, steps or
    dismount signs?)
       - • Every individual barrier, set of steps, or ‘cyclists dismount’ sign should be
          logged individually, with its own latitude, longitude and location name.
- PO03 (Does the route feel direct, logical and intuitive to understand for all
    road users?)
       - • Every indirect, illogical or unintuitive section of the route should be logged
          individually.
       - • Users can select any latitude and longitude point on the route section to
          represent it but you should enter a description of the section and why it is
          indirect, illogical or unintuitive the Location Name and Commentary &
          Feedback columns.


18 

- PO04 (Are surfaces suitable for all users?)
    - • You should log every continuous section of surfacing which is not suitable for
       all users individually.
    - • You can pick any latitude and longitude point on the section of poor surfacing
       to represent it. You must also enter a description of the section and why it is
       unsuitable for all users in the Location Name and Commentary & Feedback
       columns.
- PO05 (Is appropriate lighting provided?)
    - • You should log every continuous section of unsuitable lighting individually.
    - • You can pick any latitude and longitude point on the section of inappropriate
       lighting to represent it. You must also enter a description of the section and
       why the lighting is inappropriate in the Location Name and Commentary &
       Feedback columns.
- PO06 (Does the route join together or join other facilities together, as part
    of a holistic, connected network?)
       - • You should log every instance where a route doesn’t quite connect with
          another route or nearby origin/destination individually.
       - • You can pick any latitude and longitude point to represent the missed
          connection. You must also enter a description of the missed connection in the
          Location Name and Commentary & Feedback columns.

6 .8 Once you have entered its location information, you should fill in the final Commentary
& Feedback box with more information about the policy conflict.

You must also check whether the proposed design introduces any new policy conflicts to
the street or path and enter these in the Policy Conflict Log, choosing ‘Design’ in the Stage
input (and ‘No’ in the Resolved by Design input).

Once you have added all policy conflicts (for both the existing situation and the proposed
design), you can revisit the Commentary and Feedback column to add suggestions as to
how to remove the policy conflict (or how ATE might help do this).

Any policy conflicts flagged as unresolved by the proposed design (existing policy conflicts
which are not resolved by the proposed design or new policy conflicts introduced by the
proposed design) will be highlighted in Route Check outputs (in the Results sections).

6 .9 You must also check whether the proposed design introduces any new policy conflicts
to the street or path and enter these in the Policy Conflict Log, choosing ‘Design’ in
the Stage column (and ‘No’ in the Resolved by Design column).

6 .10 Once you have added all policy conflicts (for both the existing situation and the
proposed design), it may be appropriate to revisit the Commentary and Feedback
column to add comments on potential solutions that might remove the policy conflict
(or where particular help might be needed from ATE).

6 .11 Any policy conflicts flagged as unresolved by the proposed design (existing policy conflicts
which are not resolved by the proposed design or new policy conflicts introduced by the
proposed design) will be highlighted in Route Check outputs (in the Results sections).



7. Critical Issues Log

7.1 If you identify any critical issues in Safety Check (see Chapter 6), you must also
add these, in much the same way as policy conflicts, using the problem mapping page.

7. 2 In Safety Check, you will assess and score the scheme (both the existing situation and
    the proposed design) against 16 safety metrics – all of which have potential critical
    conditions, called ‘critical issues’. The scoring process follows the rule of worst, which
    means that you must score any critical issue with ‘C’ even if there is only one instance
    on the street or path. However, there is only one row per metric – so if there are
    multiple issues of the same critical issue on a street or path, the metric score will be
    the same: ‘C’.
7. 3 To give an example, the critical condition for SA01 is where there are more than 2,500
    vehicles per day cutting across main walking, wheeling or cycling streams at side
    roads or priority junctions. If this condition is fulfilled at multiple side roads along a
    street, you would only record it once in the Safety Check, giving it a ‘C’ score for
    SA01.
7. 4 As one of ATE’s key aims is identifying and reducing the number of critical issues in
    any scheme, it follows that a separate log is needed to record each one. The ‘3.1
    Critical Issues Log’ section contains this log.
7. 5 When completing the Safety Check section, start with the existing street or path layout,
    and enter every critical issue in the Critical Issues Log. Then check the whole length of
    the street or path for each critical issue, as the same critical issue can appear multiple
    times.
7. 6 When you have identified a critical issue in the existing layout, choose the issue type
    from the dropdown input. 

If you identify any critical issues in Safety Check (see _Chapter 6_ ), you must also complete
the Critical Issues Log section.

In Safety Check, you will assess and score the scheme (both the existing situation and the
proposed design) against 16 safety metrics – all of which have potential critical conditions,
called ‘critical issues’. The scoring process follows the rule of worst, which means that you
must score any critical issue with ‘C’ even if there is only one instance on the street or
path. However, there is only one row per metric – so if there are multiple issues of the
same critical issue on a street or path, the metric score will be the same: ‘C’.

To give an example, the critical condition for SA01 is where there are more than 2,500
vehicles per day cutting across main walking, wheeling or cycling streams at side roads or
priority junctions. If this condition is fulfilled at multiple side roads along a street, you would
only record it once in the Safety Check, giving it a ‘C’ score for SA01.

As one of ATE’s key aims is identifying and reducing the number of critical issues in any
scheme, it follows that a separate log is needed to record each one. The ‘3.1 Critical
Issues Log’ section contains this log.

When completing the Safety Check section, start with the existing street or path layout, and
enter every critical issue in the Critical Issues Log. Then check the whole length of the
street or path for each critical issue, as the same critical issue can appear multiple times.

When you have identified a critical issue in the existing layout, choose the issue type from
the dropdown column in the Critical Issue column (column F). This will automatically
generate a Critical Reference ID in the preceding column (Figure 11).

The next column (column H) asks you to enter the Stage (‘Existing’ or ‘Design’). In the
worked example, you should select ‘Existing’ from the dropdown. Next, you should enter
information about the location of the critical issue in the Latitude and Longitude column
(column I) and the Location Name column (column J).

```
Commented [TH16]: We are missing info on how to 'count'
critical issues / their discreteness

7.7 The next column (column H) asks you to enter the Stage (‘Existing’ or ‘Design’). In the
worked example, you should select ‘Existing’ from the dropdown. Next, you should
enter information about the location of the critical issue in the Latitude and Longitude
column (column I) and the Location Name column (column J).

You should add location information for each critical issue. The way to do this is the same
as how you add location information to policy conflicts in the Policy Conflict Log. This is set
out in _Chapter 5_. In short, you must record latitude and longitude for each critical issue, as
well as a description of the location to aid the understanding of anyone reviewing the tool,
such as an ATE Inspector, an LA officer or a local councillor.

Once you have entered location information, you should fill in the final Commentary &
Feedback column (column L) with more information about the critical issue. Once you
have added all the critical issues present in the existing layout, you should check whether
the proposed design removes or resolves them and put this information in the Resolved by
Design column (column K).

8. Street Check

8 .1 The Street Check assesses streets against a further series of metrics categorised
according to the other key active travel design principles: accessibility, comfort,
directness, attractiveness and coherence. Designing according to these principles
alongside safety, is essential in enabling more people to walk, wheel and cycle,
including people with disabilities, according to researched best practice internationally
and across the UK.

8.2 Many metrics in the Street Check relate to more than one key active travel design
principle. For example, metric ST17 (Gradient) is in the accessibility category, however,
route gradient can also affect people’s experience in terms of comfort and
attractiveness. Similarly, metrics in the Safety Check can also relate to other key active
travel design principles beyond safety.

8.3 The design aspects that the metrics in the Street Check assess are not considered to
have critical conditions, as they are less linked with safety and collisions risks than the
metrics assessed in the Safety Check.

8.4 The Street Check works in the same way as the Safety Check. Each metric has a title
and a description. You must assess the scheme against the scoring criteria for each
metric and enter a score for both the existing layout and the proposed design.
The scores possible are ‘0’, ‘1’ or ‘2’. It is possible to mark certain metrics as not
applicable (‘N/A’) but there is no ‘C’ option as these metrics do not have critical
conditions. An example of where ‘N/A’ might be selected is metric ST32 (pedestrian
delay at standalone signal crossings). If there are no standalone signal crossings on
the street, then you should choose ‘N/A’.

8.5 As an example, you would score metric ST34 (Places to Rest) as follows:

- Score 2 points if it is less than 50m between resting points.
- Score 1 point if it is between 50 and 150m between resting points.
- Score 0 points if it is over 150m between resting points.

8.6 As with the Safety Check, the score entered should reflect the ‘rule of worst,’ that is,
the score should reflect the worst conditions on the route. In the example above, if
there are any instances along the street where it is over 150m between resting points,
then you should give the metric a score of ‘0’. You should always provide any
assumptions in the comments/assumptions boxes, along with comments and
information to help anyone reviewing the scheme understand the justifications for your
original scores.

8.7 There are 26 metrics assessed in the Street Check. These metrics are only relevant if
you are assessing a street. If you are assessing a path, you will not be able to access this section.

8.8 Seven of the 26 street metrics apply only to cycling, while only six apply to walking and
wheeling. Only one street metric (ST21) applies to wheeling alone and the remaining


```
12 metrics apply to all three modes. You can find information on which metrics apply
to which modes in the ‘Mode’ column in the Route Check spreadsheet.
```
8.9 The 26 metrics in Street Check are given below, organised by category (key design
principle). Note that numbering starts at 17 to reflect that you should already have
scored the street against 16 metrics as part of your Safety Check.

```

9. Street Placemaking Check

9 .1 The Street Placemaking Check assesses streets against 26 metrics to assess design
quality in terms of placemaking. Placemaking is an important part of how a street is
used as it can increase the connection between people and the areas they share and
travel through.

9.2 As with Street Check, Street Placemaking Check metrics do not have potential critical
conditions, as they are less linked with collision risks than the metrics assessed by
Safety Check.

9.3 As with Street Check, you should assess both the existing layout and the proposed
design against the scoring descriptors for each metric and give a score of ‘0’, ‘1’ or ‘2.’
Follow the rule of worst when scoring. You should always provide any assumptions in
the comments/assumptions boxes, along with comments and information to help
anyone reviewing the scheme understand the justifications for your original scores.

9.4 For example, you would score metric SP19 (Planting) as follows:

- The street scores 2 if there is a variety of suitable planting that provides habitats for
    fauna and wider experiential benefits.
- The street scores 1 if there are some planted elements providing visual interest.
- The street scores 0 if there is little or no planting, providing limited visual interest.

9.5 Unlike Street Check, there are no ‘N/A’ options possible when scoring metrics.
Placemaking metrics are not associated with any particular transport mode – the
quality of place will affect the experience of anyone travelling through or spending time
in the space.

9.6 You should only assess these metrics if you are assessing a street. If you are
assessing a path, then you should skip this section. There is an equivalent Path
Placemaking Check in the ‘5.2 Path Placemaking’ section, which is covered in Chapter 11
of this user manual.

9.7 You can see the 26 metrics in the Street Placemaking Check below, organised into the
following categories: social activity, personal security, character and legibility, and
environment. The metrics have the SP prefix and numbering restarts at 1 to reflect the
fact the Street Placemaking Check is a separate part of the Route Check assessment.


Social Activity

SP01. Street Engagement for Children

SP02. Social Space

SP03. Diversity of Activities

Personal Security

SP04. Surveillance and Activity

SP05. Forward Visibility and Escape Routes

SP06. Visibility of Others

Character and Legibility

SP07. Maintenance and Upkeep

SP08. Street Network Layout

SP09. Place and Movement

SP10. Impact of Street Design on Behaviour

SP17. Drainage and Water

SP18. Trees

SP19. Planting

SP20. Ancillary Features to Support Fauna

SP21. Sustainable Materials

SP22. Air Pollution – Exposure

SP23. Air Pollution – Proximity

SP24. Noise Pollution

SP25. Light Pollution

SP26. Sunlight


10. Path Check

10 .1 Traffic-free paths are an important part of the walking, wheeling and cycling network
in both urban and rural areas. However, given the differences compared to schemes
based on streets, they need to be assessed against different criteria.

10.2 At this time, the Path Check is strictly for routes that are not shared with motor traffic
(with the exception of minor access points).

10.3 The Path Check assesses traffic-free paths against a further series of metrics,
categorized according to further key active travel design principles: accessibility,
comfort, directness, attractiveness and coherence. Designing in line with these five
principles, alongside safety, is essential in allowing more people to walk, wheel and
cycle, including people with disabilities.

10.4 Many metrics in the Path Check relate to more than one key active travel design
principle. For example, metric PA19 (Gradient) sits in the accessibility category, but
the gradient of a route can also affect people’s experience of it in terms of comfort
and attractiveness.

10.5 The design aspects that these metrics assess are not considered to have critical
conditions as they are less linked with safety and collision risks than the metrics
assessed in the Safety Check.

10.6 Before scoring the metrics in the Path Check, you must first answer a question on
whether horse riders are expected to use the route. This question is asked in the top
left-hand corner of the section. By default, the answer box will say ‘unanswered’ and be
coloured red until you choose ‘yes’ or ‘no’ from the dropdown menu.

10.7 If horse riders are expected on the route and you choose ‘yes’, then a score for horse
riding will be produced in the results section alongside a score for walking, wheeling and
cycling. You now have up to three extra metrics to score (PA25, PA29 and PA46).
If no horse riders are expected on the route, you should choose the ‘N/A’ (not
applicable) answer for these three metrics.

10.8 Apart from the first extra question about horses, the Path Check functions like other
sections of the Route Check tool. You must assess the scheme against the scoring
criteria for each metric and enter a score for both the existing situation and the design
proposals. The possible scores are ‘0’, ‘1’ or ‘2’. There is no option ‘C’, as these
metrics do not have critical conditions.

10.9 For example, you would score metric PA28 (Cycling Surface) as follows:

- Score 2 points if the cycling surface is machine-laid asphalt or smooth, firm blocks.
- Score 1 point if the cycling surface is hand-laid asphalt or smooth blocks.
- Score 0 points if the cycling surface is unsurfaced/unbound or unstable blocks/
    sets.


10.10 As with the Safety Check, the score entered should reflect the ‘rule of worst’, in that it
should reflect the worst conditions on the route. In the example above, if the cycling
surface is unsurfaced anywhere along the path, then the metric should be given a
score of ‘0’. You should always provide any assumptions in the comments/
assumptions boxes, along with comments and information to help anyone reviewing
the scheme understand the justifications for your original scores.

10 .11 There are 30 metrics assessed in the Path Check. Some of these are similar to
metrics in the Street Check and the Street Placemaking Check, however, many are
different. Some Path Check metrics are based on the quality standards in Sustrans’s
Traffic-Free Routes and Greenways Design Guide.^3 There are also metrics relating to
horse riding.^4 You only assess the 30 Path Check metrics if you are assessing a path.
If you are assessing a street, this section should be skipped. There is an equivalent Street
Check in the ‘4.1 Street Check’ section, which is covered in Chapter 8.

10 .12 Of the 30 path metrics, three only apply to cycling, while four apply to walking and
wheeling. Three metrics only apply to horse-riding, three metrics only apply to
walking, wheeling and cycling and 17 metrics apply to all active modes, including
horse riders if they are expected on the route. Information on which metrics apply to
which modes is included in the ‘Mode’ column in the Route Check spreadsheet.

10 .13 The 30 Path Check metrics are given below and organised by category (key design
principle). Note that numbering starts at 17 to reflect that you should already have
scored the path against 16 metrics as part of the Safety Check.

11. Path Placemaking Check

11.1 The Path Placemaking Check assesses paths against 19 metrics to evaluate design
quality in terms of placemaking. Placemaking is an important part of how a path
functions as it can increase the connection between people and the places they
share and travel through. There is some overlap with the 26 Street Placemaking
metrics, but they are not identical.

11. 2 The metrics in the Street Placemaking Check do not have critical conditions, as they
    are less linked with collision risks than the metrics assessed in Safety Check.
11. 3 As with other Route Check sections, you should assess both the existing layout and
    the proposed design against the scoring descriptors for each metric and give them a
    score of ‘0,’ ‘1’ or ‘2’. Follow the ‘rule of worst’ when scoring. You should always
    provide any assumptions in the comments/assumptions boxes, along with comments
    and information to help anyone reviewing the scheme understand the justifications for
    your original scores.
11. 4 For example, you score metric PP06 (Visibility of Others) as follows:
    - The path scores 2 if there is lighting that does not create high-contrast areas with
       shadows and the path environment does not create hiding or loitering places.
    - The path scores 1 if there is inadequate lighting, or bright lighting that creates high
       contrast areas with shadows.
    - The path scores 0 if there is no lighting and/or a path environment that creates
       potential ambush points.
11. 5 No ‘N/A’ options are possible when scoring metrics. Furthermore, these placemaking
    metrics are not associated with any particular mode of transport. The quality of place
    will affect the experience of anyone travelling through or spending time in the space.
11. 6 You should only assess these metrics if you are assessing a path. If you are
    assessing a street is being assessed, this section should be skipped. There is an
    equivalent Street Placemaking Check in the ‘4.2 Street Placemaking’ section, which is
    covered in Chapter 9 of this user manual.

11.7 You can see the 19 metrics in the Path Placemaking Check below, organised into the
following categories: social activity, personal security, character and legibility, and
environment. The metrics have the PP prefix and numbering restarts at 1 to reflect the
fact the Path Placemaking Check is a separate part of the Route Check assessment.

11. 8 The three personal security metrics in the Path Placemaking Check (PP04, PP05 and
    PP06) are weighted double due to the importance of personal security on paths,
    where people are less likely to be near the activity and informal surveillance of a
    street. Paths can sometimes be isolated, with fewer ‘escape points’. Things like this
    can influence how likely some user groups, such as women, are to want to walk,
    wheel or cycle on paths.

12. Junction Assessment Tool Check

12.1 The ‘9. JAT Check’ section contains the Junction Assessment Tool (JAT) Check, which
you must use to assess pedestrian and cycle movements at all junctions of a certain
type along the route.

12.2 Junctions pose the greatest collision risk to all road users, including pedestrians and
cyclists. Safety risks are often highest at junctions and the relationships between
safety, comfort and directness are most complex.

12.3 Completing a Junction Assessment Tool Check lets you assess how well a junction
caters for pedestrians and cyclists. It looks at all the potential movements at a
junction, not just those associated with a designated active travel route. It also
identifies the potential for conflicts and can help you consider what measures you
might need to reduce them.

12.4 In 2020, a version of the JAT was introduced nationally via LTN 1/20. This version of
the JAT was an adaptation of a similar tool originally published in the London Cycling
Design Standards (2014). These earlier versions of the JAT only looked at cycle
movements at junctions. However, with the publication of ATE’s Route Check tool, a
new version of the JAT is being rolled out which looks at pedestrian movements at
junctions too. When you fill in a Route Check you must assess and score cyclist and
pedestrian movements on all the types of listed below. Using this new version of the
JAT, you will be able to make junction designs better for everyone, not just people
cycling.

Applicability

12.5 You must use the JAT Check to assess and score pedestrian and cycle movements
at junctions along the following route types:

- Signal-controlled junctions
- Signal-controlled roundabouts
- Roundabouts, including mini-roundabouts.
- Large priority junctions, including four-arm crossroads junctions and three-arm
    T-junctions, but excluding small side road junctions and private driveways.

12.6 The reason that you do not need to assess side road junctions or private driveways is
that any potential critical issues at these junction types will be picked up by SA01 and
other metrics in the Safety Check.

Entering Information into the JAT Check

12.7 You must score all possible pedestrian and cycle movements at a junction for both
the existing layout and the proposed design. In terms of scoring, each movement
must be given a rating of X, 0, 1 or 2, based on its possible level of conflict, with the
worst score of 0 representing the most conflict, and X a desire line that has not been
provided for. The next two sections of this chapter describe how to score cycle and
pedestrian movements respectively.

12.8 In the JAT Check section, the space for diagrams and entering scores in tables is
organised in pairs, with each junction requiring two entries. Firstly, you must assess
the existing junction layout on the left, and then the proposed design on the right.
The junction name only needs to be entered once for each pair (on the left) and it will
automatically populate on the right.
```
```
12.9 Satellite imagery from sources like Google Maps can be used as a template for the
JAT diagram of the existing junction, as shown in Figure 14. Scheme drawings can be
used as a template for the JAT diagram of the proposed design. Street names should
ideally be visible in any satellite imagery or scheme drawings included.
```
```
12.10 You must enter all movements and associated scores into the tables in the JAT Check
as well as adding arrows to the JAT diagrams to show movements at the junction.
You can represent these movements and their scores of 0, 1, 2 and X with red,
amber, green and black arrows respectively. Cycle movements are shown with solid
arrows while pedestrian movements are shown with dashed double ended arrows.
```
```
12.11 Each pedestrian movement can be assigned a letter, and each cycle movement a
number. You can then label the arrows representing these movements on the
diagrams with these letters and numbers. Each row in the table has a comments box
where you can enter justification for how you scored individual movements. It is
recommended that you do this for all amber, red and black movements as a
minimum.
```
## Route Check User Manual

next two sections of this chapter describe how to score cycle and pedestrian movements
respectively.

In the JAT Check section, the space for diagrams and entering scores in tables is organised in
pairs, with each junction requiring two entries. Firstly, you must assess the existing
junction layout on the left, and then the proposed design on the right. The junction name
only needs to be entered once for each pair (on the left) and it will automatically populate
on the right.

Satellite imagery from sources like Google Maps can be used as a template for the JAT
diagram of the existing junction, as shown in Figure 14. Scheme drawings can be used as
a template for the JAT diagram of the proposed design. Street names should ideally be
visible in any satellite imagery or scheme drawings included.

You must enter all movements and associated scores into the tables in the JAT Check as
well as adding arrows to the JAT diagrams to show movements at the junction. You can
represent these movements and their scores of 0, 1, 2 and X with **red, amber** , **green** and
**black** arrows respectively. Cycle movements are shown with solid arrows while pedestrian
movements are shown with dashed double ended arrows.

Each pedestrian movement can be assigned a letter, and each cycle movement a number.
You can then label the arrows representing these movements on the diagrams with these
letters and numbers. Each row in the table has a comments box where you can enter
justification for how you scored individual movements. It is recommended that you do this
for all amber, red and black movements as a minimum.

```
Route Check User Manual
```
12.12 Once you have entered scores for all these movements, the spreadsheet will calculate
an overall score for the junction’s pedestrian movements, an overall score for its
cycling movements and finally, an overall JAT score for the junction combining the
two. These scores are expressed as percentages of the maximum possible score
(which is the total number of cycle and pedestrian movements at the junction
multiplied by 2, which is the highest potential score for each movement).

```
Total Sum of Scores ÷ (Total Movements × 2) = JAT Score
```
12.13 A completed table of pedestrian crossing movements for the example given above in
Figure 14 is shown below in Figure 15. You should fill in the rows completely, adding a
justification for the scoring in the comments column for at least all amber, red and
black movements. The total score is calculated based on how many entries have
been added. If you enter a crossing name in the crossing column without a score,
the spreadsheet will record a zero score. The example junction has four possible
pedestrian movements, so four rows have been filled (A-D).

## Scoring Pedestrian Movements

```
Unlike cycle movements, which are covered in LTN 1/20, pedestrian movements have no
codified scoring resource elsewhere.
```
```
Black pedestrian movements are where an obvious pedestrian desire line is somehow
blocked, or not accommodated by the physical presence of a crossing. For example, you
should also mark desire lines blocked with guard railing as black pedestrian movements.
Another example would be a pedestrian desire line on an arm of a junction with no
controlled crossing, no dropped kerbs and no tactile paving to support pedestrians wishing
to cross. Black pedestrian movements score zero.
```
```
Red pedestrian movements are where there is some form of crossing, but it is not fully
accessible and/or does not sufficiently protect pedestrians. Red pedestrian movements
therefore have high potential for conflict with motor traffic. Most red pedestrian movements
will also appear in Route Check as critical issues. Red pedestrian movements score 0 and
some examples include:
```
Figure 15 – A completed table of pedestrian movements for a junction in the JAT
check.

Scoring Pedestrian Movements

12.14 Unlike cycle movements, which are covered in LTN 1/20, pedestrian movements have
no codified scoring resource elsewhere.

12.15 Black pedestrian movements are where an obvious pedestrian desire line is
somehow blocked, or not accommodated by the physical presence of a crossing.
For example, you should also mark desire lines blocked with guard railing as black
pedestrian movements. Another example would be a pedestrian desire line on an arm
of a junction with no controlled crossing, no dropped kerbs and no tactile paving to
support pedestrians wishing to cross. Black pedestrian movements score zero.


12.16 Red pedestrian movements are where there is some form of crossing, but it is not
fully accessible and/or does not sufficiently protect pedestrians. Red pedestrian
movements therefore have high potential for conflict with motor traffic. Most red
pedestrian movements will also appear in Route Check as critical issues. Red
pedestrian movements score 0 and some examples include:

- Where a pedestrian desire line does not have adequate crossing provision.
    Adequate crossing provision means all the essential elements of a safe, fully
    accessible design, including dropped kerbs, visibility, surface condition and
    drainage, tactile paving, adequate waiting and passing space (particularly in
    shared-use situations) and gradients, etc.
- Pedestrian desire lines that conflict with more than 2,500 vehicles per day and
    have no controlled crossing provision.
- Pedestrian desire lines where pedestrians must cross at over 1.2 m/s to get across
    a crossing in time.

12.17 Amber pedestrian movements have some form of crossing provision, but it
doesn’t fully meet the needs of everyone walking and wheeling. For example, the
provision doesn’t fully meet desire lines and is less used by some pedestrians, who
many instead cross on their desire lines at increased risk. Amber pedestrian
movements score 1 and some examples include:

- Crossings located away from desire lines or which are not intuitive for the intended
    movement.
- Staggered crossings.
- Crossings with guard railing that encourages off-crossing movements.
- Crossings with excessive waiting times, either at individual crossings or
    cumulatively through a series of crossings.

12.18 Green pedestrian movements score 2. These are movements where the potential
for conflict with motor traffic has been almost entirely removed by the provision of
fit-for-purpose controlled crossings, or uncontrolled crossings that fully meet the
requirements of traffic speed, volumes and geometry.

Scoring cycle movements

12.19 Scoring cycle movements in this version of the JAT Check is exactly the same as in
the version of the JAT Check introduced in LTN 1/20. You can therefore refer to
Section 5 of Appendix B of LTN 1/20 for guidance on scoring cycle movements.


JAT Results

12.20 On route-based schemes, movements along the corridor are sometimes known as
‘principal’ or ‘golden thread’ movements. These are key movements to get right on a
route scheme and critical issues recorded for these movements should be removed
as a priority.

12.21 When you complete JAT Checks for junctions, you are also assessing movements
that are not necessarily on the ‘golden thread.’ This draws attention to potentially
unsafe pedestrian and cycle movements which the scheme might be less likely to
address.

12.22 A red movement at a junction that is not on the ‘golden thread’ could in some cases
qualify as a critical issue, but would not be recorded in the critical issues log. In cases
where ATE is involved with the scheme being removed, such red movements (and
sometimes also amber movements) are discussed via correspondence and meetings.
However, the removal of all such red movements is not necessarily a requirement of
schemes assessed by ATE, especially if such movements are mitigated.


13. Results and Scoring

13 .1 This chapter explains the three output sections in the Route Check and then gives
additional information about how scores are calculated in the Route Check.

Overview of the Results sections

13.2 The output sections in the Route Check summarise the results from the completed
sections with some further analysis. They give insight into the quality of the route,
highlighting the impacts that interventions are expected to have on the quality of the
route for people walking, wheeling and cycling.

13.3 The outputs are split into three sections:

- Results Summary – this section gives a top-level overview of Route
    Check’s findings, focusing on the change in score between the
    existing layout and the proposed design, as well as any remaining
    issues.
- Results Further Analysis – this section gives a full summary of the
    quantitative results of the assessment, with extra analysis into the
    strengths and weaknesses of the route and interventions.
- Results Export – this section gives all the Route Check results, both
    qualitative and quantitative, and is optimised for export and printing.

Why is this important?

13.4 This section of the Route Check should be used to work out whether the
interventions proposed will have the desired impact on the scheme’s objectives. If this
is not so, then these sections can help you decide which aspects of the scheme need
strengthening to have more impact.

13.5 If scheme is already delivered and constructed, Route Check results can be used to
help consider whether any remedial works are necessary and what lessons learnt you
can take forward for future schemes.

13.6 On schemes where ATE is involved, ATE can use the results sections to highlight any
remaining issues it believes need more work. Recommendations for potential
improvements and solutions will be summarised here.

Results summary section

Overview table

13.7 This table contains all the key results of the Route Check and highlights where ATE
recommend further action to remove issues.

13.8 As the table contains the key results and potential next steps from the Route Check,
it can be used as a quick reference for scheme performance. It can also be used as a
starting point to explore Route Check results further.


13.9 With the exception of the ‘Review Statement’ box, all the results in the table will
populate automatically once you have filled in the various sections of the Route Check
relevant to the review. The Policy Check and Critical Issues results simply return the
number of remaining issues that Active Travel England believes should be investigated
and resolved to deliver a quality route for people walking, wheeling and cycling,
including people with disabilities. These results are pulled from the Policy Conflict Log
and Critical Issues Log respectively.

13 .10 The rest of the table goes through the next sections of the Route Check, giving the
change in score percentage between the existing route and the intervention route.
This is to emphasise the impact the scheme has had rather than give an overall score
for the proposed scheme, which would indicate the quality of the route but not its
impact.

13 .11 The ‘Review Statement’ box is the only section in the section that needs an input.You
should use the space to give a qualitative overview of how the proposals in the Route
Check process have performed and highlight any results, caveats or next steps to
support the delivery of a quality intervention for people walking, wheeling and cycling
on the route. When ATE carries out a Route Check assessment for a scheme
submitted by a local authority, ATE will summarise its key recommendations here.

Level of service table and graph

13 .12 Under the overview table in the Results Summary section, another table and graph
summarise the street or path level of service results for the scheme. The table and
graph assess changes between the existing layout and the proposed scheme against
the six core design principles of safety, accessibility, comfort, directness,
attractiveness and cohesion.

13.13 The table and graph summarise the service level of the existing layout, the proposed
scheme and the difference between the two. These results can be used to
understand the existing level of service better and work out how much improvement
is needed. You can also see how transformational the proposed scheme might be in
terms of its different core design principles.

13 .14 When you review the results, give consideration to whether they align with core
design principles and intended scheme outcomes. For example, some schemes
might have greater emphasis on improving safety, compared to improving the
attractiveness of the route, whereas others might call for strong improvement against
all core design principles. You can then use the results to work out further
interventions that might deliver better outcomes against these objectives.

13.15 The level of service scores shown in this table represent the scores given for the
metrics you gave in the Safety Check and Street or Path Check sections. There are 16
Safety Check metrics, 26 Street Check metrics and 30 Path Check metrics.

13 .16 The core design principles that each metric belongs to are listed at the top of each of
the metrics shown in Safety Check, Street Check and Path Check, in the first column
of the spreadsheet.


Results Further Analysis section

13 .17 This section summarises the quantitative results of the Route Check. The results are
given in the same order as the Route Check and you can use them to work out the
strengths and weaknesses of the existing layout and the proposed scheme.

Summary of Scheme

13 .18 This section simply gives you a condensed list of the information you entered in the
Summary of Scheme section to contextualise the results. The table is populated through
the Summary of Scheme section but needs the route map to be copied manually from
the Summary of Scheme section and pasted in.

Policy Check Results

13 .19 The table in this section summarises the number of policy conflicts logged in the
Policy Conflict Log. From left to right, it shows:

- How many policy conflicts there are in the existing layout.
- How many policy conflicts there are in the proposed design.
- How many policy conflicts were removed. That is, how many policy conflicts were
    present in the existing layout that the proposed design removed.
- How many policy conflicts were introduced. That is, how many policy conflicts
    were not present in the existing layout but were introduced by the proposed
    design.
- The number of policy conflicts remaining in the proposed design.

13.20 If there are any remaining potential policy conflicts, the local authority or ATE should
add comments in the Policy Conflict Log section, along with an overall comment in the
Policy Check section. These comments are not shown in the Results Further Analysis section,
but pull through into the Results Export section.

Safety Check Results (Critical Issues Only)

13.21 The table in this section summarises the number of Critical Issues logged in the
Critical Issues Log. From left to right, these are:

- How many critical issues are present in the existing layout.
- How many critical issues are present in the proposed design.
- How many critical issues were removed. That is, how many critical issues were
    present in the existing layout that the proposed design removed.
- How many critical issues were introduced. That is, how many critical issues were
    not present in the existing layout but were introduced by the proposed design.
- The number of critical issues remaining in the proposed design.


13.22 If there are any remaining critical safety issues, the local authority or ATE should add
comments in the Critical Issues log. These comments are not shown in the Results
Further Analysis section, but do pull through into the Results Export section.

13.23 The Level of Service scores for the metrics in the Safety Check are not shown here
but are shown instead in the Street Check Results or Path Check Results tables
below, depending on the type of scheme you are assessing.

Street Check Results

13.24 This section summarises the results of the Street Check (if you are assessing a street
rather than a path) in three tables with accompanying graphs and charts.

13.25 First, you will see the same table and graph showing the level of service described in
the Results Summary section, specifically for the Street Check (if you have done a Path
Check, this section should be empty). For the six core design principles, the table
shows the existing level of service, the level of service provided by the proposed
design and the difference between the two. It also gives the overall scores for levels
of service. The ‘spider chart’ graph shows the two sets of levels of service for the
core design principles.

13.26 It should be noted that in terms of the overall score, Safety Check metric scores (i.e.
those with potential critical conditions) are weighted more strongly than the other
metrics. You can find more information on this later in this chapter.

13.27 The second table and chart break down the levels of service for each of the active
travel modes: walking, wheeling and cycling. It does this for both the existing layout
and the proposed design. You can use these results to understand the level of
service for different modes better and work out whether the intervention delivers
against its intended aims.

13.28 The third table and chart summarise the Street Placemaking Check results, giving the
score for the existing layout and proposed design against the four placemaking
categories (social activity, personal security, character and legibility, and environment).
You can use these results to understand the scheme’s quality of placemaking better
and check whether it successfully achieves any placemaking objectives.

Path Check Results

13.29 This section summarises the Path Check results (if you are assessing a path rather
than a street) in two tables with accompanying graphs and charts.

13.30 First, you will see the same table and graph showing the service level described in
the Results Summary section, specifically for the Path Check (if you have done a Street
Check, this section should be empty). For the six core design principles, the table
shows the existing level of service, the level of service provided by the proposed
design and the difference between the two. It also gives overall scores for all the
levels of service. The ‘spider chart’ graph shows the two sets of levels for the core
design principles.


13.31 The second table and chart break down the levels of service for each of the active
travel modes: walking, wheeling, cycling and (if applicable) horse riding. It does this
for both the existing layout and the proposed design. You can use these results to
understand the level of service for the different modes better and work out whether
the intervention delivers against its intended aims.

13.32 The third table and chart summarise the Path Placemaking Check results, giving the
score for the existing layout and proposed design against the four placemaking
categories (social activity, personal security, character and legibility and environment).
These results can be used to understand the placemaking quality of the scheme
better and check whether it successfully achieves any placemaking objectives.

Junctions Assessment Check Results

13.33 A summary table is provided for up to five junctions if completed within the Junction
Assessment section. The table gives overall scores for each junction (including scores for
the existing layout, proposed layout and the difference between the two), as well as a
breakdown by mode: walking and wheeling (combined) and cycling. You can use the
table can be used to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the junctions
along the route better and work out if any one mode is receiving a higher level of
service than the others.

13.34 Average scores across up to five junctions are given at the bottom of the table.

13.35 If you are assessing more than five junctions, a message will appear under the table
to let you know that subsequent junctions are not included in the summary table.

Results Export section

13.36 This section summarises all the quantitative and qualitative results from Route Check in a
single section. You can use it as an authoritative review of Route Check showing the
results from Route Check, along with any additional comments about potential policy
conflicts and critical issues that Active Travel England believes should be further
investigated to support the delivery of a quality route for people walking, wheeling
and cycling.

13.37 It contains all the same tables, charts and graphs in the Results Further Analysis section,
with the following additions:

- The Overview Table from the Results Summary section.
- A table listing any remaining policy conflicts from the Policy Conflict Log, including
    their reference ID, type and location information plus any comments and feedback.
- A table listing any remaining critical issues from the Critical Issues Log, including
    their reference ID, type and location information plus any comments and feedback.

13.38 The remaining policy conflicts and critical issues listed in the tables are simply those
present in the proposed design, whether they are unresolved policy conflicts and
critical issues from the existing layout, or new ones introduced by the proposed
design.


Exporting the Results

13.39 The Results Export section has been formatted so that Route Check results are
optimised for printing, whether as a hard copy or a PDF.

How Scores are calculated in the Route Check

13.40 The following sections give extra detail on how the Route Check calculates scores.
Scores are given as percentages in the Route Check but you can see here how these
percentages are derived.

Safety Check Scoring

13.41 There are up to 16 metrics scored in the Safety Check, which can range in score
from 0-2. Critical issues can also be scored as 0 but marked with a C and included in
the Critical Issues log, which is subject to additional scrutiny.

13.42 Not all metrics are relevant to every scheme and the total possible score may be
lower depending on the number of metrics that you review a scheme against.

13.43 As safety is an integral part of any active travel scheme, Safety Check scores are
factored by three, which gives Safety Check metrics extra weighting in the overall
level of service score compared with Street Check or Path Check metrics. As there
are 16 Safety Check metrics, the total possible Safety Check score is therefore 96.

Street Check Scoring

13.44 There are up to 42 metrics scored in the Street Check. The first 16 of these are
metrics in the Safety Check section, while the remaining 26 are the metrics in the Street
Check section. The 26 metrics in the Street Check section can range in score from 0-2.

13.45 Not all metrics are relevant to every scheme and scores may be lower depending on
the number of metrics that you review a scheme against.

13.46 As noted in the previous section, the Safety Check level score is factored by three
and included within the overall Street Check level of service score.

```
Category Metrics Total possible score
Safety 16 96 (16x2x3)
Accessibility 7 14
Comfort 3 6
Directness 6 12
Attractiveness 6 12
Cohesion 4 8
Summary 42 148
```

Street Placemaking Check Scoring

13.47 There are 26 metrics scored in the Street Placemaking Check, across four categories,
with the possible score for each metric ranging from 0-2. Scores in the results sections
are presented as percentages.

```
Category Metrics Total possible score
Social Activity 3 6
Personal Security 3 6
Character and Legibility 10 20
Environmental 10 20
Summary 26 52
```
Path Check Scoring

13.48 There are up to 46 metrics scored for the Path Check. The first 16 of these are the
metrics in the Safety Check section, while the remaining 30 are the metrics in the Path
Check section. The 30 metrics in the Path Check section can range in score from 0-2.

13.49 Not all metrics are relevant to every scheme and scores may be lower depending on
the number of metrics that you review a scheme against. This is the main reason that
scores are presented as percentages.

13.50 As noted in the ‘Safety Check’ section, the Safety Check level of service score is
factored by three and included in the overall Path Check level of service score.

```
Category Metrics Total possible score
Safety 16 96 (16x2x3)
Accessibility 5 10
Comfort 11 22
Directness 4 8
Attractiveness 5 10
Cohesion 5 10
Summary 46 156
```

Path Placemaking Check Scoring

13.51 There are 19 metrics scored in the Path Placemaking Check, across four categories,
with the possible score for each metric ranging from 0-2.

13.52 The three metrics in the Personal Security category are factored by two for reasons
explained in Chapter 11.

```
Category Metrics Total possible score
Social Activity 3 6
Personal Security 3 12 (3x2x2)
Character and Legibility 4 8
Environmental 9 18
Summary 19 44
