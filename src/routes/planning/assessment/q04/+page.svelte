    <p>
      Are a range of local amenities, and town centres, railway stations,
      employment areas and the National Cycle Network as appropriate, accessible
      for cyclists using well-designed routes?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div slot="shortfalls">
    <p>
      Cycle routes relied on by the development are not coherent, direct, safe,
      comfortable or attractive in line with the five core design principles and
      geometric requirements in LTN 1/20 (see Sections 4.2 and 5). This may be
      due to physical features, steps, steep gradients or surface quality; or
      the absence of ramps, lighting or appropriate crossing facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development relies on shared use routes in full or intermittently,
      which conflict with the governmentâ€™s clear position in Gear Change (p. 17,
      21 and 41) and paragraph 1.6.1 (2) in LTN 1/20 that cycles must be treated
      as vehicles and not as pedestrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is insufficient protection from motor traffic in accordance with the
      suitability and segregation standards in LTN 1/20 (see Figure 4.1 and
      Section 6) such that some potential cyclists would be excluded.
