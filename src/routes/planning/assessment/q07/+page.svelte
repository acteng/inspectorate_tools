      Does the development prioritise pedestrian and cycle movements within the
      site?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div slot="shortfalls">
    <p>
      Opportunities have been missed to maximise accessibility for active travel
      modes, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the development does not provide or safeguard pedestrian and cycling
        connections to neighbouring sites including future phases of development
      </li>
      <li>
        routes for pedestrians and cyclists are not at least as direct – and
        preferably more direct – than the equivalent by car
      </li>
      <li>
        routes are not fully accessible or do not have adjacent accessible
        alternatives (e.g. ramps alongside steps or bound paths next to unbound
        paths)
      </li>
      <li>
        inappropriate or infrequent crossings are proposed (see Inclusive
        Mobility Sections 4.10-4.11, PAS 6463 Section 7.6.2, LTN 1/20 Table
        10-2, Manual for Streets Section 6.3 and Manual for Steets 2 Section
        9.3)
      </li>
      <li>
        pedestrians and cyclists are not prioritised at side road crossing
        points (see LTN 1/20 Figure 10.13)
      </li>
      <li>
        priority junctions have radii that interrupts the pedestrian desire line
        (see Manual for Streets Sections 6.3-6.4 and Manual for Streets 2
        Section 9.4)
      </li>
      <li>
        there are red/zero scores when applying the Junction Assessment Tool in
        LTN 1/20
      </li>
      <li>signalised junctions do not have pedestrian aspects on some arms</li>
      <li>
        where cyclists would mix with motor vehicles, lane widths are between
        3.2m and 3.9m (paragraph 7.2.5 of LTN 1/20 identifies that such widths
        allow motor vehicles to drive alongside a cyclist without a safety
        margin for their comfort and protection)
      </li>
      <li>
        there are unsafe transitions for cyclists when moving between cycleways
        on and off the carriageway, or
      </li>
      <li>
        cycleways within commercial sites are not continuous through to cycle
        parking areas
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Shared use routes for pedestrians and cyclists are proposed and these do
      not meet the limited situations listed in paragraph 6.5.6 of LTN 1/20.
      Where shared use routes are acceptable, their widths are below 3m (&lt;300
      cyclists per hour) or below 4.5m elsewhere, contrary to LTN 1/20 Table
      6-3.
