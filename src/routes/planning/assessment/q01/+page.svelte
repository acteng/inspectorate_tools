      Does the application appropriately forecast all day trips to, from and
      within the site by walking, wheeling and cycling?

      Source data is not representative of the proposed development, is
      out-of-date or is confined to commuting journeys only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forecasted trip generation is limited to motor vehicle traffic or peak
      hours only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future year forecasts do not realise the potential of the development to
      support a greater number of walking, wheeling and cycling journeys or do
      not align with the governmentâ€™s vision in Gear Change (or any adopted
      local targets) that half of all journeys in towns and cities shall be
      walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.
