    <p>
      Does the development establish a strong sense of place, with well-designed
      streets, public spaces that feel safe and key amenities provided?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div slot="shortfalls">
    <p>
      The design of streets does not encourage social interaction or create
      attractive, safe and accessible open spaces that would support an active
      life for everyone, contrary to the National Design Guide (See Part 2).
      This may include missed opportunities to incorporate green infrastructure
      / street trees, shared space residential streets (such as appropriately
      designed home-zones, mews and culs-de-sac), equipped play facilities,
      seating at regular intervals, and clear lines of sight to assist with
      orientation (including measures to prevent inconsiderate parking).
    </p>
    <p>
      Aspects of the proposed design give rise to personal and highway safety
      concerns, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        streets, public transport nodes and other public spaces do not benefit
        from appropriate levels of natural surveillance and lighting
      </li>
      <li>
        the requirements of disabled people have not been appropriately
        considered
      </li>
      <li>
        the development includes 'blind-spots', sharp turns or high-sided
        boundary treatments
      </li>
      <li>
        the development does not provide continuous and legible routes or is not
        supported by an effective wayfinding strategy, or
      </li>
      <li>
        residential or local streets encourage traffic movements through the
        site or are not designed for a 20mph speed limit (see Manual for Streets
        Section 7.4 for guidance on achieving appropriate traffic speeds)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are gaps in the provision of well-located, on-site amenities to
      support the quantum of development proposed, in conflict with paragraph 83
      of the National Design Guide. For larger residential-led developments,
      this may include a lack of evidence that the applicant has utilised local
      authority pupil yield data (or the Department for Educationâ€™s Pupil Yield
      Dashboard in the absence of such) to inform the need for new schools and
      early years settings.
