      Has an appropriate assessment on the design and accessibility of existing
      active travel routes in the locality of the site been presented?
    </p>

  <div slot="shortfalls">
    <p>
      Local pedestrian and cycling routes are only identified in application
      documents by their location, with no assessment provided on whether these
      are safe, direct, convenient and accessible for people of all abilities
      (paragraph 82 of the National Design Guide) or coherent, direct, safe,
      comfortable and attractive (core design principles in LTN 1/20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Applications that include new dwellings have not demonstrated how local
      schools and colleges will be accessed by active travel modes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qualitative analysis to inform any necessary improvements to the design
      and accessibility of key routes does not include maps, photographs and
      comments nor has regard to the following guidance, tools and plans in the
