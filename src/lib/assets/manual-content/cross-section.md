## Route Cross-Section Tool User Manual

Publication date: February

All Active Travel England tools and user manuals will be reviewed regularly and updated
as needed.

## 1. Introduction

1.1 This user manual is a desktop guide for the Route Cross-Section Tool. The tool is a
‘design assistance’ tool, created to show the user what infrastructure may be possible
along a highway corridor in terms of available width. The tool lets users test different
hypothetical cross-sections and provides guidance on what infrastructure is desirable
as well as highlighting important issues. The tool aligns with current national guidance,
sign-posting users to relevant passages in LTN 1/20^1 , Inclusive Mobility^2 and The
Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB)^3 as appropriate.

1.2 The Route Cross-Section Tool can be used at any stage of the design process for
highway corridor projects but it is most useful in the pre-feasibility/concept stages.
It shows the user how to design high-quality walking, wheeling and cycling
infrastructure for the widest-possible range of street users, including people with
disabilities, within the constraints of the available space. It can be used alongside
ATE’s Route Check tool to help designers and other transport professionals find
ways of maximising design quality and service levels within the available space.
Values used in the Route Cross-Section Tool (such as minimum footway widths)
are consistent with those used in the Route Check tool.

1.3 This tool is not suitable for assessing area-wide schemes, school streets, cycle parking
or networks of routes.

1.4 First and foremost, the tool is a design aid, rooted in best practice, to help users
provide infrastructure in line with the latest national guidance. It is not an audit, and it
does not give answers, and while it is comprehensive, it may not cover all possible
eventualities and contexts. It is the responsibility of the scheme designer to be familiar
with the relevant design codes and work out the most suitable options that balance
all the needs of a street.

## 3. Summary of Scheme

3 .1 It is important that you fill in the Summary of Scheme tab to make sure there is a
complete and accurate record of key scheme information. You should fill in all the
Summary of Scheme tab fields before moving on to the next tab. If you do not have
some of this information, you can get in touch with a relevant member of ATE’s
Regional Management team.

3.2 The fields in the first table in the Summary of Scheme tab are as follows:

- Scheme Reference – the relevant funding programme scheme reference, where
    applicable.
- Scheme Name – the scheme name according to the funding programme.
- Scheme Summary – use to provide a brief description of the scheme including
    any relevant programme-level information.
- Authority – the provisioning authority for the scheme.
- Transport/Combined Authority – the combined authority, where the scheme falls
    under a combined authority area.
- Region – the part of England where the scheme is located. There are also options
    for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
- Funding Programme – the main funding source for the scheme.
- Design Stage – the current design stage of the scheme.
- Funding Conditions – any specific conditions regarding infrastructure attached to
    the relevant funding programme.
- Route Length Assessed in this File (km) – the length of route assessed in the
    specific Excel tool copy.
- Total Route Length (km) – where the scheme is part of a longer scheme,
    assessed over multiple Excel tool copies.
- Notes is a space for the user to add any other relevant notes on the scheme.

3.3 There are additional spaces below the first table where you must give the network
context by providing co-ordinates for the start and end of the route being assessed,
along with a map showing the route in its wider context. You must include the
locations of each cross-section taken along it on this map, and label them with the
reference number corresponding to their entry in the Cross-Section Check ta b (#1,
#2, #3 etc.), so they can easily be identified. There is more information on where to
take cross-sections in the Cross-Section Check part of this user manual.

## 4. Proposed Cross-Sections

4 .1 In this tab, you will enter contextual information to work out what types of infrastructure
are suitable for the locations you are assessing. You can build different cross-sections
to standards and test them to see if they fit the available space.

4.2 You must start by adding the data asked for in the ‘Traffic data and additional
information’ table. These inputs are mandatory, and the tool will not work if all the
relevant fields are not populated. The exception to this rule are cells C8, C9, C10 &
C11. You should only fill in these cells if applicable to the proposed cross-section.
For example, you can leave out ‘Expected peak hour cycle flow: shared use cycle
tracks’ (cell C11) if you are not proposing any shared-use cycle tracks.

the Proposed Cross-Sections tab

4.3 Next, you must fill in the ‘Desirable Minimum Cross-Section’ table. You will build your
ideal cross-section here:

Figure 3 – Partial screenshot of a completed ‘Desirable Minimum Cross-Section’
table in the Proposed Cross-Sections tab.

4.4 You will build the desired cross-section as follows:

```
a. First, choose a point on the corridor that looks wide enough to fit the infrastructure you
want to include. Next, measure this width using the most accurate method available
(Topographical data is best, followed by OS data. You can use Google Earth in the
absence of topographical or OS data, although it is less reliable). The width measured
should be the full width of the adopted highway.
```
```
b. Now, enter this width in cell F/G23.
```

Route Cross-Section Tool User Manual

```
c. You can then build the proposed cross-section in Row 15 using the dropdown options
```
- see Appendix A for these and any important points to note. As you start to work
through this, some cells in this section will autocomplete with:
    - links to references in the relevant guidance e.g., LTN 1/20 and a brief
       summary;
    - suggested considerations where the proposed cross-section does not comply
       with guidance; and
    - desirable minimum widths for each feature, based on the relevant guidance.

As you add features to the cross-section, you will see the total width needed to accommodate
them shown in cell F/G22. You can clearly identify whether this total width exceeds the
available width you entered into cell F/G23 by comparing the numbers in cells F/G22 and F/G23.
For additional clarity, cell F/G23 will turn red if there is not enough width available (see Figure 4
below). If this happens, you may need to propose an alternative cross-section in the ‘Absolute
Minimum Cross-Section’ table, as described in (e).

Figure 4 – Partial Screenshot showing an example of completed Total Width Required
(m) and Available Width (m) cells.

```
d. You can add up to eight extra items for any feature types that are not covered in the
preset options (see Figure 5) in the ‘Custom Street Features’ table. These custom
features will then appear in the dropdown lists in row 15. Any spare width highlighted
as available by the tool could be used for features such as rain gardens and other
sustainable drainage features, benches and resting places, additional planting and/or
trees. Adding these to the street improves the Placemaking score in ATE’s separate
Route Check tool. The names you give these custom features must not be the same
as any of the existing options in the dropdown menus on row 15.
```

```
Route Cross-Section Tool User Manual
```
Figure 5 – Partial screenshots of the Proposed Cross-Sections tab showing how a
user can add a 1.4m wide SUDS (Sustainable Drainage Systems) feature as
a custom street feature.
e. Where the available highway width will not accommodate features at their desirable
minimum widths, you can use the ‘Absolute Minimum Cross-Section’ table to test if the
same features will fit based on the absolute minimum widths allowed in the relevant
guidance. To check this, you should input the same features in the same order that you
used in the ‘Desirable Minimum Cross-Section’ table and enter the same value for
available width in cell F/G35. Any custom options you entered previously can also be used
here and will be set to the width requirements specified in the ‘Custom Street Features’
table. The absolute minimum widths in row 33 will then default to the minimum allowed as
specified in the relevant guidance and the tool will provide the total width needed in cell F/
G22. It will also highlight if the total width needed exceeds the available width.

4.5 If either the desirable minimum or absolute minimum cross-sections include shared-
use cycle tracks, the tool will remind you that you will need to justify this in light of
LTN 1/20 guidance in row 9 of the Cross-Sections Check tab – see guidance on
this tab below.

## 5. Cross-Sections Check

5 .1 This tab tests if the desirable minimum or absolute minimum cross-sections built in the
Proposed Cross-Sections tab can be delivered at regular intervals along the route,
and at any constrained or atypical locations.

5.2 A cross-section deliverability test should be completed:

- Once for every homogenous section of route, where the total available width and
    the proposed features are the same.
- At every ‘pinch point’ where there is less available width, and at every atypical
    section along the route, to make sure that every challenging location is tested.

The first cross-section deliverability test, for group (1) above, is covered in the first table in the
tab: Checking possible cross-sections of homogenous sections of route along the proposed
corridor.

Figure 6 – Partial screenshot of the first table in the Cross-Sections Check tab,
which checks which cross-sections are possible at different homogenous
sections along the proposed corridor.

5.3 To complete this section, you should measure the available width for each
homogenous section of route where the width stays similar and enter these values in
row 7. You must make sure that the map you put in the Summary of Scheme tab is
marked-up with the locations of cross-sections and that you clearly label each of these
with the matching Cross-Section # from row 6.

5.4 You should be as accurate as possible with every measurement you enter in the tool,
as confidence in the output of the Route Cross-Section Tool depends on the quality
of the measurements you put into it.

5.5 Once you have entered the available width, the Cross-Sections Possible (row 8) will
auto-populate to show whether your proposed cross-section will fit that location.

Figure 7 – Partial screenshot of the Cross-Sections Check tab showing which (if any)
cross-sections are possible at the first three cross-sections (of
homogenous sections of route) made.

5.6 The second cross-section deliverability test, for group (2) above, is covered in the
second table: Checking possible cross-sections of any constrained or atypical
locations along the corridor.


```
Route Cross-Section Tool User Manual
```
5.7 You now need to locate any pinch-points or atypical sections of the route and repeat
the exercise described above, to check which cross-sections are possible at more
constrained or challenging places along the route. You should also add a reference in
row 14 to allow locations to be pin-pointed and enter the available width at each
location into row 15.

Figure 8 – Partial screenshot of the second table in the Cross-Sections Check tab,
which checks which cross-sections are possible at constrained or atypical
locations along the proposed corridor.

5.8 For any locations where the cross-section does not fit the available width, in rows 9 &
10, and 17 & 18, you must then provide a description of what would need to change in
order to fit the infrastructure in and what, if anything, could change in order to fit a
more suitable cross-section there.

Figure 9 – Partial screenshot of the Cross-Sections Check tab showing which (if any)
cross-sections are possible at the three constrained or atypical cross-
sections along the route. This screenshot also shows example comments
on the results.

5.9 When considering alternative arrangements, you must make sure that schemes
implementing cycling infrastructure do not compromise pedestrian facilities
unacceptably. Wherever you propose shared-use cycle tracks in cross-sections,
the tool will remind you to justify these against LTN 1/20 guidance. Shared-use cycle
tracks are not suitable for many locations and contexts and should only ever be a
last resort when all other possible options have been considered and evidenced
as undeliverable.

```
The width needed is taken from Table 5-2 in LTN 1/20 with an
extra 0.3m added to allow for the minimum width needed to
accommodate protection to the track (2 back-to-back kerbs,
light segregation, etc). If you need an extra buffer to a traffic
lane and width is very constrained, this extra 0.3m can be
taken off the buffer width: use Custom Street Features to
create a custom-width buffer.
